Although they have some thickness, paper, film, and cloth are examples of two-dimensional materials."

The use of 'archival' in commercial advertising to describe products suitable for materials and implying an infinite life span has made this use of the word nearly meaningless; some products so described would never be used by most archivists for such purposes.",

LOCKSS creates low-cost, persistent digital 'caches' of authoritative versions of http-delivered content.  The LOCKSS software enables institutions to locally collect, store, preserve, and archive authorized content thus safeguarding their community's access to that content.  The LOCKSS model enforces the publisher's access control systems and, for many publishers, does no harm to their business models. \n\n\u00b6  Accuracy and completeness of LOCKSS caches are assured through a peer-to-peer polling and reputation system (operated through LCAP, LOCKSS' communication protocol), which is both robust and secure. LOCKSS replicas cooperate to detect and repair preservation failures. LOCKSS is designed to run on inexpensive hardware and to require almost no technical administration.  The software has been under development since 1999 and is distributed as open source.\n\n  "

(These early marks also included many pomme crosses, based on the Greek cross with balls or circles at the ends of the cross bars. A similar watermark, found on Italian paper of the 14th century, consists of a circle above which is a patriarchal or papal cross. These earliest marks were prevalent from about 1282 to 1425); 2) watermarks emphasizing man and his works. (Thousands of designs of this nature have been noted, a large number of them featuring human hands in various forms); 3) watermarks consisting of flowers, fruit, grains, trees and other plants, etc.; and 4) watermarks consisting of wild, domesticated, and legendary animals.

      "Metadata is commonly defined as \"data about data.\"  Metadata is frequently used to locate or manage information resources by abstracting or classifying those resources or by capturing information not inherent in the resource.  Typically metadata is organized into distinct categories and relies on conventions to establish the values for each category.  For example, administrative metadata may include the date and source of acquisition, disposal date, and disposal method.  Descriptive metadata may include information about the content and form of the materials.  Preservation metadata may record activities to protect or extend the life of the resource, such as reformatting.  Structural metadata may indicate the interrelationships between discrete information resources, such as page numbers.", 
      "In terms of archives, MARC format and EAD are standards for structuring descriptive metadata about collections.  Dublin Core is a standard for structuring metadata that is intended for describing web resources. ",

To the extent that data is a record, it may also include administrative, descriptive, preservation, and structural information."

Americans were not interested in the landscape marked by man's presence but they regarded nature as a virgin territory, a landscape that had not been sullied by human kind, in which the hand of God, its creator, could be seen.

        "quotation": "\n  \u2020(METS 2003) Maintaining a library of digital objects of necessity requires maintaining metadata about those objects. The metadata necessary for successful management and use of digital objects is both more extensive than and different from the metadata used for managing collections of printed works and other physical materials. While a library may record descriptive metadata regarding a book in its collection, the book will not dissolve into a series of unconnected pages if the library fails to record structural metadata regarding the book's organization, nor will scholars be unable to evaluate the book's worth if the library fails to note that the book was produced using a Ryobi offset press. The same cannot be said for a digital version of the same book. Without structural metadata, the page image or text files comprising the digital work are of little use, and without technical metadata regarding the digitization process, scholars may be unsure of how accurate a reflection of the original the digital version provides. For internal management purposes, a library must have access to appropriate technical metadata in order to periodically refresh and migrate the data, ensuring the durability of valuable resources.\n\n\u00b6  The Making of America II project (MOA2) attempted to address these issues in part by providing an encoding format for descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata for textual and image-based works. METS, a Digital Library Federation initiative, attempts to build upon the work of MOA2 and provide an XML document format for encoding metadata necessary for both management of digital library objects within a repository and exchange of such objects between repositories (or between repositories and their users). Depending on its use, a METS document could be used in the role of Submission Information Package (SIP), Archival Information Package (AIP), or Dissemination Information Package (DIP) within the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model.

      "These utilities grew out of cooperative cataloging projects in libraries, allowing one library to catalog a book and other libraries to use that record in their catalog.  The utilities were able to exploit the information in the database to provide interlibrary loan services to member libraries and to provide subscribers the ability to search for works across many libraries' holdings.  One factor motivating archives' use of the MARC format was to enable descriptions of archival collections to be entered, searched, and retrieved  in these utilities alongside related materials from other repositories.  Two prominent utilities are OCLC and RLIN."

Considering the application of FOIA exemption 7(c) to a rap sheet, the court held that where the subject of a rap sheet is a private citizen and the information is in the Government's control as a compilation, rather than as a record of what the Government is up to, the privacy interest in maintaining the rap sheet's 'practical obscurity' is always at its apex while the FOIA-based public interest in disclosure is at its nadir. Thus, as a categorical matter, rap sheets are excluded from disclosure by the exemption in such circumstances.  "

In the United States, many records are kept in a public office to provide constructive notice. Examples include, records of real property; births, marriages, and deaths (vital records); judicial decisions; minutes of public meetings.  Many of these records are held by the office of a city or town clerk, a county recorder, or the secretary of state."

The curator, with a mandate to collect for aesthetic reasons, isolates the photographs from the context of creation and offers them up for, what Svetlana Alpers calls, 'attentive looking' and thereby transforms documents into art.

      "Invented by Louis Jacques Mand\u00e9 Daguerre in the late 1830s and announced publicly in 1839, daguerreotypes were the first practical photographic process.  They remained common until the popularization of the ambrotype in 1854.  The surface is highly reflective.  The image appears as a positive when viewed while reflecting a dark background and as a negative when reflecting a light background.  The image is monochromatic, although color may have been added by hand.  Unless special camera optics were used, the image is laterally reversed.  The surface is fragile and may be tarnished.  To protect the image, a daguerreotype is almost always mounted under glass with a paper seal around the edge; most daguerreotypes are mounted in a hinged case."

De facto standards often result when one vendor dominates a market, while prescribed standards develop in competitive environments where market participants realize that agreement upon a standard will benefit all of the participants. De facto standards incite little argument, because the market as a whole decides them. However, prescribed standards cause much consternation, because of the often contentious processes that lead to their establishment.  "

Unlike instant messaging, the sender and recipients do not need simultaneous connections to send or receive email.  The header includes information that enables the messages to be delivered and additional metadata to identify, classify, and contextualize the message.  The body is often plain or formatted text; it may contain embedded graphics or sound, although not all email readers can properly parse anything beyond plain ASCII.  Attachments may be in any format, such as word processing documents, spreadsheets, or media files.  ", 
      "An email system requires an application, sometimes called a mail user agent (MUA), client, or reader, that incorporates a simple text editor used to compose messages and to send and receive messages.  The system also requires a mail transport agent (MTA) to store and forward messages.  An email system may be implemented on a closed network using proprietary software to exchange messages.  However, an email system typically formats messages using the RFC 2822 or MIME standards when the messages are to be exchanged with another system.  Email systems commonly transmit messages using the simple mail transport protocol (SMTP).  Many MUAs and MTAs are based on the POP3 or IMAP standards to allow interoperability between different systems.",

An author is said to have the \"moral right\" to control her work. The concept of moral rights thus relies on the connection between an author and her creation. Moral rights protect the personal and reputational, rather than purely monetary, value of a work to its creator. . . . \n\n\u00b6  In the U.S., moral rights are primarily protected by VARA. Before VARA was passed, courts and commentators struggled to find moral rights in the \"derivative work\" provision of the Copyright Act, the laws of defamation, the rights of privacy and publicity, the doctrine of misappropriation, and especially the Lanham Act, which deals with trademarks and unfair competition.  Authors may seek moral rights protection from state moral rights laws and art preservation statutes in California and New York, whose provisions resemble those of VARA. Authors whose works are not covered by VARA and the state statutes may also seek moral rights-type protection from various other sources of law.  "

      "In general, cold begins at 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and continues down to 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C).  Sometimes cool storage (65\u00b0F to 40\u00b0F, 18\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C) is distinguished from cold storage (40\u00b0F to 0\u00b0F, 18\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C).  Because deterioration caused by chemical reactions is directly related to temperature (see Arrhenius function), keeping materials at a lower temperature can significantly slow the effects of aging. A number of standards include precise definitions of cold, based on the materials to be stored.  See, for example, Storage: Paper Records (NISO TR01), Storage: Photographic Film (ANSI/PIMA IT9.11/ISO 5466), and Storage: Optical Disc Media (ANSI/PIMA IT9.25). ", 
      "Cold storage is frequently used to stabilize large quantities of materials. Cold storage is particularly effective for color and nitrate photographs and motion pictures.  In cool storage, materials can be paged directly to a reading room without acclimatization.  In cold storage, materials may be kept at freezing temperatures and must go through a staging process to bring them up to temperature where they can be used safely."

        "quotation": "\n  \u2020(Bantin 1998) The life cycle model for managing records, as articulated by Theodore Schellenberg and others, has been the prominent model for North American archivists and records managers since at least the 1960s. . . . This model portrays the life of a record as going through various stages or periods, much like a living organism. In stage one, the record is created, presumably for a legitimate reason and according to certain standards. In the second stage, the record goes through an active period when it has maximum primary value and is used or referred to frequently by the creating office and others involved in decision making. During this time the record is stored on-site in the active or current files of the creating office. At the end of stage two the record may be reviewed and determined to have no further value, at which point it is destroyed, or the record can enter stage three, where it is relegated to a semi-active status, which means it still has value, but is not needed for day-to-day decision making. Because the record need not be consulted regularly, it is often stored in a off-site storage center. At the end of stage three, another review occurs, at which point a determination is made to destroy or send the record to stage four, which is reserved for inactive records with long-term, indefinite, archival value. This small percentage of records (normally estimated at approximately five per cent of the total documentation) is sent to an archival repository, where specific activities are undertaken to preserve and describe the records.\n\n\u00b6 The life cycle model not only describes what will happen to a record, it also defines who will manage the record during each stage. During the creation and active periods, the record creators have primary responsibility for managing the record, although records managers may well be involved to various degrees. In the semi-active stage, it is the records manager who takes center stage and assumes major responsibility for managing the records. Finally, in the inactive stage, the archivist takes the lead in preserving, describing, and providing access to the archival record.  "

In the twentieth century before 1960 practices were added from the public archives field from time to time.  By 1960 the nature of collecting itself had changed from a concentration on papers of remote vintage to an emphasis on those of recent origin.  The latter had many characteristics of public archives, because of their comparable extent, structure, and depth of documentation.  \u00b6  The historical manuscripts tradition is rooted in librarianship.  Because manuscripts were generally brought under some form of library administration, it is understandable that library techniques would be applied to them.  . . .  Because of their rarity (unique handwritten items) and their separation from related papers, the collected materials were handled as discrete items.   "

The differences that developed meant that the historical manuscripts tradition would remain linked to techniques of librarianship.  Public archives, meanwhile, would develop along lines derived from European archival institutions where theory and practice had long been the object of scholarly discourse and refinement.  "

The British practice, we believed, if applied in the National Archives, could lead sometimes to groupings too large for administrative convenience. We thought it better to divide the records of such large 'agencies' as departments into a number of separate record groups, usually reflecting the bureaus within departments and of 'convenient size' for administration.\n\n\u00b6  On the Continent the French term 'fonds d'archives' \u2013 meaning the body or stock of records of a record-creating unit \u2013 was widely known in archival literature and accepted as the basis of arrangement work. . . .  As applied in practice, the records of any subordinate office that kept records, no matter how small the office, were considered a 'fonds.'  This was going to the other extreme of 'convenient size,' and the 'record group' principle as defined in the National Archives united the records of subordinate offices under their superior offices, usually up to the bureau level.  Also the records of small though essentially independent satellite agencies were often included with the records of major agencies to which they were related.  "

Richey issued an injunction against the EOP (including the NSC), holding that based on the characteristics of the proprietary e-mail systems in place within the EOP and NSC at the time, the defendants' written records policies directing that hard copies of e-mail messages be printed out as the sole means of preserving e-mail records was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to the U.S. federal records laws. [Note: Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 810 F. Supp. 335 (D.D.C. 1993).] This holding was affirmed on later appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. [Note: See Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993). On January 15, 1993, the government's emergency motion for a partial stay of the district court's Order was granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals, allowing EOP components to delete e-mail messages from their live operating systems, so long as all record information was preserved in identical form on backup tapes. Order of January 15, 1993, Civ. No. 93-5002 (D.C. Cir.). ]  "

As archivists, should we simply welcome this popularization of the term 'archives' or should we be bothered by the prevalence of its frequent misuse?   Perhaps we should look only on the positive side and see that the growing recognition of the value and importance of documentation that [David] Gracy sought. On the other hand, there is in the popularized use of 'archives' a rather significant threat to the basic goals of the archival profession. Call it paranoia, but I always have the sense that when we see 'archive' used as a verb, or the word 'archives' used in a bastardized way to describe what is clearly a singular, idiosyncratic, and synthetic gathering of documents, we are being confronted with a challenge to our position as professional archivists.

For electronic recordkeeping systems, direct savings may include salary savings over the life of the project as a result of increased efficiency, as well as increased functionality and improved customer satisfaction.",

The effect was to stop for twenty years the addition of any published work to the public domain.  As Roy Rosenzweig noted in a recent article in the Journal of American History, '[f]or historians, copyright protection has redlined . . . much twentieth-century history. . . .'  In response, a group of publishers and preservationists filed suit challenging the constitutionality of copyright term extension.  The suit, Eldred v. Ashcroft, argues that 'perpetual copyright on the installment plan' is in direct violation of the constitutional stipulation that the monopoly rights granted by copyright be for a limited term.  The suit has lost in the Federal Appeals court, and recently the plaintiffs asked the Supreme Court to rule on the issue. \u00b6  A coalition of information organizations, including the Society of American Archivists, the Association of Research Libraries, the American Library Association, the Digital Futures Coalition, and others have filed an amicus brief with the Court asking that they hear the case.  The brief notes the irreparable harm done to historians and institutions that exploit the public domain when copyright term is excessive.  "

As general rules, these are intended to be broadly applicable to descriptions of archives regardless of the nature or extent of the unit of description.

They know it conflicts with the present and offers both intellectually and spiritually enriching perspectives on life.  In the other world, we see well-funded, slick, and often superficial presentations of the past that generally reflect a single harmonious, monolithic, and monocultural image, free from disturbing incidents or experiences that might engender the question of 'why.' \u00b6  The social appropriation of the past for commercial and political use is a complex phenomenon. One the one hand, it bolsters public interest in history and would seem beneficial to archives.  On the other hand, much of the mass market appeal of history seems to operate on a more superficial and sinister level.  There is a strong primary emphasis on the emotive appeal of the past; nostalgia and 'event experiences' are very much in contrast to documentary-based examinations of the past where the evidence can be removed and reexamined.

A closed system has defined inputs and outputs, but without additional information about the system it is impossible to make that system do anything else.  An open system exposes its internal workings, allowing others to understand how the system works.  In principle, others can then interact with, modify, or add to the system.

Even though documents and other two-dimensional materials are artifacts because of their physical nature, 'artifact' is often used to distinguish three-dimensional materials from two-dimensional materials. Artifacts may be preserved as records, documenting a design or function. For example, throughout the 19th century the United States Patent Office required models of inventions as part of the patent record.  In addition, many archival record groups and manuscript collections contain artifacts among other more traditional visual and textual material, such as a campaign button filed with the flyer documenting the political rally at which it was acquired. - Examples of artifact2 include specks in a digital image not in the original, but resulting from noise in the scanning process."

      "A copy1 can vary significantly in its fidelity to the original.   In some instances, it may be sufficient for a copy to capture only the intellectual content of the record without regard to formatting (see fair copy).  Or it may be an exacting facsimile of the original.  Because there is always some loss of quality when making a copy, originals have greater authenticity than copies. Hence originals are preferred over copies for evidence (see best evidence).  The value of the information is not increased by repetition.  However, the presence of many copies of a record may serve as a check on the trustworthiness of a record; the presence of multiple, identical copies suggests that the record has not be altered.  ", 
      " Similarly, publication has been used as a means to preserve records by distributing copies among many owners and many locations to increase the odds that at least one copy will survive if others are lost or damaged. - Copy1, 2 and duplicate1 are often synonyms.  However, 'copy' connotes a something reproduced from an original; for example, a Xerox copy.  'Duplicate' connotes a version that may be considered an original; for example, duplicate prints made from the same negative. - A copy1, 2 made with the intent to deceive is often described as a forgery or a counterfeit.  A copy or similar work made by the creator of the original is often described as a replica or version."

      "Printing-out papers were prevalent from the invention of photography through most of the 19th century.  A negative was sandwiched between glass and a sheet of printing-out paper in a frame, and the whole was then placed in the sun.  The light slowly changed the silver halide to metallic silver. The photographer could monitor the printing progress in reduced light by pulling the paper away from the negative; if more exposure was needed, the sandwich was returned to sunlight to continue printing.  After exposure, the prints were fixed to halt further development.  Printing-out papers produce images that are a purplish brown and were usually toned to a purple black. Unfixed printing-out paper, often used for portrait proof prints, are often rust-colored and show signs of silver mirroring.  Eastman Kodak marketed printing-out paper under the name Studio Proof, intended specifically for portrait proofs."

This example calls for a judge to balance four factors, and no one factor definitively weighs for or against fair use.

If the document is not deacidified before lamination, it will continue to deteriorate through inherent vice.

As a result, reds and oranges in the original appear much darker relative to blues and greens of equal brightness.  Early photographic materials, especially film and plates used in the camera, were orthochromatic.  Most  black-and-white photographic papers continue to use orthochromatic emulsions, allowing the materials to be handled in the darkroom under red light."

      "Many tests are based on the Arrhenius function, which predicts that materials age in a predictable manner relative to temperature.  By determining how long it takes for materials in an environment with an elevated temperature to reach a predetermined level of deterioration (brittleness, fading, signal loss), it is possible to project how long it will take materials at normal storage conditions to reach that level of deterioration.  Because the level of deterioration is set arbitrarily, the test has a subjective aspect that makes results open to dispute.  For example, the test may accurately predict the time it will take film to reach a predicted level of brittleness, but some individuals would find the film to be sufficiently pliable to remain useful."

In litigation, a large records series may be sampled to determine if that series is likely to contain relevant materials. - Sampling2 determines the quality of the digital recording; the higher the frequency of the sampling rate and the greater the range of values that can be captured, the closer the digital version approximates the original performance being recorded."

If we think of admissibility as a question of disclosure or nondisclosure, it us usually easy to say whether or not an item of evidence has been admitted.  When we consider the question of permissible use, the concept seems much more complicated. In the first place, evidence may be 'admissible' for one purpose but not for another. . . .  In the second place, questions of the permissible use of evidence do not arise only at the time of disclosure to the trier of fact. The court may have to consider admissibility in deciding whether to give the jury a limiting instruction, whether or not an opponent's rebuttal evidence is relevant, and whether or not counsel can argue to the jury that the evidence proves a particular point.

Such artificial aging experiments are sometimes called 'Arrhenius-tests'.  "

Similarly, some electronic document content is not fixed, but may change over time; for example, a word processing document that pulls data from a constantly changing database.  These documents are described as dynamic documents to distinguish them from traditional, fixed documents   ", 
      "In some contexts, document3 refers to an item that is not a record2, 3, such as drafts, duplicates of record copies, and materials not directly relating to business activities.  In this sense, documents are not usually included on retention schedules and can be disposed of without authorization. ", 
      "However, in other contexts, document4 is used synonymously with record2, 3. In this sense, 'record' connotes an official document, especially the final version of one created in the routine course of business with the specific purpose of keeping information for later use as evidence or proof of the thing to which it refers. ", 
      "In some instances, there are clear distinctions between a document and a record. For example, in civil litigation in the United States all documents held by an organization are discoverable. However, those documents are admissible as evidence only if they fall within the definition of business record in the Federal Rules of Evidence (or state equivalent).", 
      "Document1 is often used interchangeably with 'publication', although this use has the sense of many identical copies in distribution.  This use is common in state and federal depository libraries that collect government documents. ", 
      "A document's content may reflect formula and conventions in its structure, including formal rules of representation, literary style, and specialized language that reflect the author's political, professional, or social cultures.  A document's physical characteristics may also follow conventions relating to the medium, organization of internal elements, and presentation of the information."

Another data warehousing pioneer, Richard Hackathorn, describes the data warehouse as a single image of the business reality [citing Lambert].\n\n\u00b6  Data warehouses are becoming an increasingly popular tool for the management of data. The most fundamental reason for this is, firstly, that executives need rapid, easy access to data for planning and control. Secondly, data have historically been stored in disparate systems, in multiple locations, which made a complete view of organizational data almost impossible [citing Laudon & Laudon].  "

Under such a policy, backup tapes and hard drives would not be governed by an inaccurate characterization of them as retention systems, but rather by a proper understanding of their role in providing for system reconstruction in the event of loss of functionality.\n\n[Note:] Unlike archival systems, which contemplate restoring data, in part or whole, to an existing, active system to be used along with other active data, backup systems are designed to completely restore active systems that have been lost or corrupted as the result of some disaster. Therefore, while data stored in offline archives may often be restored to the active system and searched, searching backup files often requires either taking active data off the system or 'cloning' the system. Both alternatives involve significant disruptions and expense.  "

Supposing for example that a Viceroy sends home to the Secretary of State in England an elephant with a suitable covering-note or label; or supposing, to take a more actual example, that the Government of a Colony presents to the First Commissioner of Works in London a two-hundred foot spar of Douglas Pine: the question may be imagined to arise: Is the spar 'annexed' to correspondence with the Government of British Columbia? Is the elephant attached to the label or the label to the elephant? \u00b6 The answer to those who would put this dilemma to us in the present connexion is that the Administration would be obliged in all such cases to solve the question of housing \u2013 to send the spar to Kew Gardens or the elephant to the Zoo \u2013 long before the label or letter comes into charge of the Archivist: the problem is an Administrative, not an Archive one.

As the technology came into common use, a screw-powered letter press was used in conjunction with a press book, a bound volume of blank, tissue paper pages.  A letter freshly written in special copying ink was placed on a dampened page while the rest of the pages were protected by oilcloths.  The book was then closed and the mechanical press screwed down tightly.  The pressure and moisture caused an impression of the letter to be retained on the underside of the tissue sheet.  This impression could then be read through the top of the thin paper. \u00b6 These letter presses were used by some individuals and businessmen in the first half of the nineteenth century, but they only came into general use in the second half of the century. \u00b6 A letter press reduced the labor cost, both by decreasing copying time and by allowing an office boy to do the copying once performed by a more expensive clerk.  As the same time, it eliminated the danger of miscopying.  Copies were now facsimiles of the letter sent, down to the signature.  "

Surviving documents on such paper show that it was watermarked with the belled cap of a court jester, a 'fool's cap,' and that watermark (still in use as part of the tradition of papermaking) is an evident source of the term.  But this paper was originally imported from Italy, and is attested in XVIII as Genoa foolscap.  In It. such a sheet was called un foglio capo, a chief (large) sheet.  If foglio is given an English plural as foglios capo, the resultant form is very close to foolscap, whereby one must conclude that the term derives from both the watermark and the Italian name.  "

A dark area would be made up of many large dots, which may bleed into each other to form a solid.  A light area has a few small dots, or no dots at all, allowing the light-colored base to reflect light.  Color images may be printed in halftone by separating the original into its four component colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) and combining each as a separate halftone."

Where we particularly should be taking issue with the mass media use of the past is when it is used for escapism from the present.

      "In the vernacular, 'archives' is often used to refer to any collection of documents that are old or of historical interest, regardless of how they are organized; in this sense, the term is synonymous with permanent records.  That use is reflected by archives6, as used within the e-prints community and periodicals such as The Archives of Internal Medicine.  Within the professional literature, archives are characterized by an organic nature, growing out of the process of creating and receiving records in the course of the routine activities of the creator (its provenance).  In this sense, archivists have differentiated archives from artificial collections.", 
      "Many archivists, especially those in the United States who are influenced by the thinking of Theodore Schellenberg, follow an inclusive definition of archives, which encompasses a wide variety of documents and records.  Schellenberg also distinguished between the primary and secondary value of the materials; only materials with secondary value, value beyond their original purpose, could be considered archival. For Schellenberg, archivists appraise records for transfer to the archives on the basis of their secondary, research, evidential, or informational value. ", 
      "Other archivists follow the writing of Hilary Jenkinson, who argues that archives are 'documents which formed part of an official transaction and were preserved for official reference.'  For Jenkinson, the records creator is responsible for determining which records should be transferred to the archives for preservation.  Because Jenkinson emphasized that records are evidence of transactions, he did not recognize any collections of historical documents as archives, although he noted that collections of personal papers were of value to historians because they complemented archives. ", 
      "'Manuscript repository' is sometimes used instead of archives3 to distinguish an organization that collects personal papers from an agency that collects the records of its parent organization.", 
      "Some United States archivists deprecate the use of the form 'archive' (without the final s) as a noun, but that form is common in other English-speaking countries.  However, the noun 'archive' is commonly used to describe collections of backup data in information technology literature."

The information content of any physical objects, or logical data, cannot be measured or discussed until it is known what range of possibilities existed before and after they were received. The information lies in the reduction in uncertainty resulting from the receipt of the objects or the data, and not in the size of complexity of the objects or data themselves. Questions of the form, function, and semantic import of data are only relevant to information inasmuch as they contribute to the reduction of uncertainty.

Of course, if no archival theory or practice could be allowed unless it was 'perfect,' we would have not theory or practice.  Ultimately, the question becomes whether appraisal based on [use analysis], granted its many imperfections, is better or worse than the proposed practical alternatives. The second is that its practicality and broad applicability depends upon a growing number of use studies. Because every repository serves a somewhat different clientele, has a different mandate from its resource allocators, and must deploy different resources, in an ideal world, every repository would do it own detailed use studies for every segment of its collections.  These could be as simple as the MHS call-slip analysis, as complex as a process of user interviews, or as intensive as a citation analysis.  The world not being ideal, most repositories will have to extrapolate from studies done by similar institutions regarding similar records.  The third is that this is not a Magic Bullet.  Utilitarian appraisal does not equal 'easy' appraisal.  Unless we abandon appraisal as an archival responsibility, we will never make appraisal easy because we can never make it scientific or mechanistic.  If it were otherwise, I am convinced, there would be absolutely no reason for archivists to exist.  But a utilitarian method will provide a better rigor and rationale for appraisal decisions.  "

        "quotation": "\n  \u2020(McCullagh and Caelli 2000) There is a definitional distinction between the legal use of the term 'non-repudiation' and its crypto-technical use. In the legal sense an alleged signatory to a document is always able to repudiate a signature that has been attributed to him or her. The basis for a repudiation of a traditional signature may include: \nThe signature is a forgery; \nThe signature is not a forgery, but was obtained via\n  unconscionable conduct by a party to a transaction,  \n  fraud instigated by a third party, \n  undue influence exerted by a third party.  \n\n\u00b6 There appears to be a movement within the electronic commerce environment to take away these fundamental rights that exist within common law jurisdictions. The general rule of evidence is that if a person denies a particular signature then it falls upon the relying party to prove that the signature is truly that of the person denying it. It should be understood that the term 'deny' and the term 'repudiate' are synonymous and this position is supported by standard dictionary definitions. \n\n\u00b6  Furthermore, the common law trust mechanism established to overcome a false claim of non-repudiation is witnessing. Witnessing simply occurs at the time the signature is being affixed. That is, by having an independent adult witness the signing of a document reduces the ability of the signatory to successfully deny the signature as a forgery at a later date. It is always open for the signatory to deny the signature on other grounds such as those enumerated above.  [Citations omitted.]  "

Therefore, it's up to individual companies to determine what information qualifies as intellectual and knowledge-based assets. In general, however, intellectual and knowledge-based assets fall into one of two categories: explicit or tacit. Included among the former are assets such as patents, trademarks, business plans, marketing research and customer lists. As a general rule of thumb, explicit knowledge consists of anything that can be documented, archived and codified, often with the help of IT. Much harder to grasp is the concept of tacit knowledge, or the know-how contained in people's heads. The challenge inherent with tacit knowledge is figuring out how to recognize, generate, share and manage it. While IT in the form of e-mail, groupware, instant messaging and related technologies can help facilitate the dissemination of tacit knowledge, identifying tacit knowledge in the first place is a major hurdle for most organizations.

The need for careful examination of these characteristics is arising again, however, thanks to the advent of new technology.  Computer software, for example, may be considered as part of the extrinsic 'script,' because it determines the layout and articulation of the discourse, and can provide information about provenance, procedures, processes, uses, modes of transmission and, last but not least, authenticity.

The strategy they propose includes: defining a collecting area; analyzing existing collections; determining the documentary universe, including relevant government records, printed and other sources; prioritizing industrial sectors, individual businesses, geographic regions, and time periods from which records will be sought; defining functions performed by businesses and the collecting levels needed to document major functions; connecting documentary levels to priority tiers; and updating this process every three to seven years. They outline priority factors used in making these decisions, documentation levels, and decision points to refine the priority levels. This Minnesota Method combines features of archival approaches to collection analysis, documentation strategy, appraisal, and functional analysis.  "

The copyright laws of the United States grant certain rights to copyright owners for the protection of their works of authorship. Among these rights is the right to make, and to authorize others to make, a reproduction of the copyrighted work, and the right to distribute, and to authorize others to distribute, the copyrighted work. Both the reproduction right and the distribution right granted to a copyright owner inhere in all works of authorship and are, for the most part, exclusive rights. However, for copyright holders of nondramatic musical works, the exclusivity of the reproduction right and distribution right are limited by the compulsory license of section 115 of the Copyright Act. Often referred to as the 'mechanical license,' section 115 grants third parties a nonexclusive license to make and distribute phonorecords of nondramatic musical works. The license can be invoked once a nondramatic musical work embodied in a phonorecord is distributed 'to the public in the United States under the authority of the copyright owner.' 17 U.S.C. 115(a)(1). Unless and until such an act occurs, the copyright owner's rights in the musical work remain exclusive, and the compulsory license does not apply. Once it does occur, the license permits anyone to make and distribute phonorecords of the musical work provided, of course, that they comply with all of the royalty and accounting requirements of section 115. It is important to note that the mechanical license only permits the making and distribution of phonorecords of a musical work, and does not permit the use of a sound recording created by someone else. The compulsory licensee must either assemble his own musicians, singers, recording engineers and equipment, or obtain permission from the copyright owner to use a preexisting sound recording. One who obtains permission to use another's sound recording is eligible to use the compulsory license for the musical composition that is performed on the sound recording. The mechanical license was the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law, having its origin in the 1909 Copyright Act. It operated successfully for many years, and it continued under the 1976 Copyright Act with only some technical modifications. However, in 1995, Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act ('Digital Performance Act'), Public Law 104-39, 109 Stat. 336, which amended sections 114 and 115 of the Copyright Act to take account of technological changes which were beginning to enable digital transmission of sound recordings. With respect to section 115, the Act expanded the scope of the mechanical license to include the right to distribute, or authorize the distribution of, a phonorecord by means of a digital transmission which constitutes a 'digital phonorecord delivery.' \n\n  "

A bibliographic description, such as that found in a MARC record, represents an individual published item, and thus is item-level. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the description and the item. The description is based on, and is derived from, the physical item. Archival description represents a fonds, a complex body of materials, frequently in more than one form or medium, sharing a common provenance. The description involves a complex hierarchical and progressive analysis. It begins by describing the whole, then proceeds to identify and describe sub-components of the whole, and sub-components of sub-components, and so on. Frequently, but by no means always, the description terminates with a description of individual items. The description emphasizes the intellectual structure and content of the material, rather than their physical characteristics.  "

Letters as a form of personal correspondence had of course existed for many centuries.  They were already used in commerce, mainly for external communication.  The conventions of letter writing were well established.  These included the date of writing, a formal salutation ('Dear . . . ') as well as a formal closing ('Your most . . .') . . . As the letter was increasingly used for internal communication, within and across departments, the new business experts, masters of efficiency, argued for a much simplified format.  Typing time could be saved if the company printed up letterheads with fields such as To, From, and Subject, and if openings and closings were stripped down to a bare minimum. . . . \u00b6 . . . The 'Subject' field had a double purpose.  It of course gave the recipient a quick way to determine what the memo was about.  But it was equally important as a resource for a new class of workers, the file clerk.  It helped the clerk determine where in the vertical files to store the memo.  "

Thus, no organisational view on data existed. These different data definitions also lead to inconsistent reports that cannot be used by management for decision making. In turn, the inconsistent reports cause users not to trust reports and organisational data. These problems were aggravated by the fact that data that went into the DSS systems were sometimes 'dirty' or inaccurate as there was no 'scrubbing' or cleansing process to ensure accurate data, presented in a uniform format. Lastly, data were shared reluctantly in business-unit-centric systems, and the data were not integrated, requiring complicated bridges to share data [citing Moss & Adelman 1999a]. The shortcomings of DSS systems became profound as the users of these systems changed from administrators at a tactical level to analysts and managers at the strategic level.  "

Each separation is used to print a different color dye, the images superimposed so that the combination reproduces the full color of the original.  Some processes create a fourth separation used to include black for added density.  Separations are usually on film to make printing plates or prints.  However, individual separation prints are sometimes made as proofs during printing. - An example of separation2 is stereo recording, which must minimize crossover between left and right channels. - Separation3 often involves replacing the item with a separation sheet.

However, Marshall McLuhan's observation that \"The medium is the message\" is a reminder that physical characteristics influence meaning.  In the case of a reformatted photograph, some information embedded in the material nature of the original will be lost in the reproduction.  For example, a modern copy print of a 19th-century cabinet print will almost certainly use a different process, may not be the same size, and may not reproduce the back; the process, size, and date, which can help date the original, are missing from the reformatted copy.", 
      "Data files may be reformatted so that they can be read by different programs or to counter technological obsolescence.  For example, a document created in Word 5 must be reformatted before it can be read by Word XP or by any version of WordPerfect.  Or, home movies may be reformatted to DVDs.  Such reformatting may be imperfect, with a resulting loss of meaning."

These factors included not only the well known litany of pesticide misuse problems (resistance and non-target effects), but also the rapid development of technologies enabling more sophisticated approaches, primarily due to rapid advances in communication and computing, with the allied new sciences of operations research, systems analysis, and modeling.  \u00b6 \n\nAlthough much of the initial push for IPM came from California researchers in sympathetic response to Rachael Carson's Silent Spring, national acceptance of IPM as a philosophy and technology can be traced to 1970 to the first symposium of agricultural scientists brought together to discuss IPM in a conference held at North Carolina State University, which was jointly funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, NSF, and USDA/CSRS.

Deletion occurs in several levels on modern computer systems: (a) File level deletion: Deletion on the file level renders the file inaccessible to the operating system and normal application programs and marks the space occupied by the file's directory entry and contents as free space, available to reuse for data storage. (b) Record level deletion: Deletion on the record level occurs when a data structure, like a database table, contains multiple records; deletion at this level renders the record inaccessible to the database management system (DBMS) and usually marks the space occupied by the record as available for reuse by the DBMS, although in some cases the space is never reused until the database is compacted. Record level deletion is also characteristic of many e-mail systems. (c) Byte level deletion: Deletion at the byte level occurs when text or other information is deleted from the file content (such as the deletion of text from a word processing file); such deletion may render the deleted data inaccessible to the application intended to be used in processing the file, but may not actually remove the data from the file's content until a process such as compaction or rewriting of the file causes the deleted data to be overwritten.

Record appraisal then becomes a matter of identifying or creating records which best document the institution's functions.  Because it is institutionally based, functional analysis implicitly shuns any prioritization among similar institutions, and suggests that there is a universal and objective set of records which comprise 'adequate' documentation of each and every example of a particular type of institution.

Most often, incoming records are housed in modern office-quality folders and boxes that meet short-term rather than long-term retention requirements. \n\n\u00b6  With these points in mind, a holdings maintenance program has three major procedural objectives: \nto place documents into a good primary housing (a container that fully encloses them, supports them, and protects them from the environment); \nwithin the container, to group documents into folders for additional protection and support and to enhance safe access; \nto place documents that are severely damaged or vulnerable into individual enclosures. \n\n\u00b6  Also defined in a holdings maintenance program are the four functional, design, and compositional features of the housing supplies \u2013 the containers, folders, and sleeves \u2013 used during the course of work: \nhousings and enclosures must perform their assigned function; \nthey must be as simple and straightforward to use as possible to facilitate easy and safe access to the documents; \nthey must not contain any structural features that will physically damage or jeopardize the documents; \nthey must be made of stable materials that will not contribute to the deterioration of the documents in the present or the future.

These formulae constitute the final clauses, which can be divided into groups as follows: \n\u00b6 Clauses of injunction: those expressing the obligation of all those concerned to conform to the will of the authority. \n\u00b6 Clauses of prohibition: those expressing the prohibition to violate the enactment or oppose it. \n\u00b6 Clauses of derogation: those expressing the obligation to respect the enactment, notwithstanding other orders or decisions contrary to it, opposition, appeals or previous dispositions. \n\u00b6 Clauses of exception: those expressing situations, conditions or persons which would constitute an exception to the enactment. \n\u00b6 Clauses of obligation: those expressing the obligation of the parties to respect the act, for themselves and for their successors or descendants. \n\u00b6 Clauses of renunciation: those expressing a threat of punishment should the enactment be violated.  They comprise two categories: 1) spiritual sanctions, comprising threats of malediction or anathema; 2) penal sanctions, comprising the mention of specific penal consequences. \n\u00b6 Promissory clauses: those expressing the promise of a prize, usually of a spiritual nature, for those who respect the enactment. \n\u00b6 Clauses of corroboration: those enunciating the means used to validate the document and guarantee its authenticity.  The wording changes according to the time and place, but these clauses are usually formulaic and fixed.

        "quotation": "\n  \u2020(W3C/IETF URI Planning 2001) There is some confusion in the web community over the partitioning of URI space, specifically, the relationship among the concepts of URL, URN, and URI. The confusion owes to the incompatibility between two different views of URI partitioning, which we call the 'classical' and 'contemporary' views.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6  1.1 Classical View\n\u00b6  During the early years of discussion of web identifiers (early to mid 90s), people assumed that an identifier type would be cast into one of two (or possibly more) classes. An identifier might specify the location of a resource (a URL) or its name (a URN) independent of location. Thus a URI was either a URL or a URN. There was discussion about generalizing this by addition of a discrete number of additional classes; for example, a URI might point to metadata rather than the resource itself, in which case the URI would be a URC (citation). URI space was thus viewed as partitioned into subspaces: URL and URN, and additional subspaces, to be defined. The only such additional space ever proposed was URC and there never was any buy-in; so without loss of generality it's reasonable to say that URI space was thought to be partitioned into two classes: URL and URN. Thus for example, 'http:' was a URL scheme, and 'isbn:' would (someday) be a URN scheme. Any new scheme would be cast into one or the other of these two classes.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6  1.2 Contemporary View\n\u00b6  Over time, the importance of this additional level of hierarchy seemed to lessen; the view became that an individual scheme does not need to be cast into one of a discrete set of URI types such as 'URL', 'URN', 'URC', etc. Web-identifier schemes are in general URI schemes; a given URI scheme may define subspaces. Thus 'http:' is a URI scheme. 'urn:' is also a URI scheme; it defines subspaces, called 'namespaces'. For example, the set of URNs of the form 'urn:isbn:n-nn-nnnnnn-n' is a URN namespace. ('isbn' is an URN namespace identifier. It is not a 'URN scheme' nor a 'URI scheme').\n\n\u00b6  Further according to the contemporary view, the term 'URL' does not refer to a formal partition of URI space; rather, URL is a useful but informal concept: a URL is a type of URI that identifies a resource via a representation of its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network 'location'), rather than by some other attributes it may have. Thus as we noted, 'http:' is a URI scheme. An http URI is a URL. The phrase 'URL scheme' is now used infrequently, usually to refer to some subclass of URI schemes which exclude URNs.  "

The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc. Past events, it is argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written records and in human memories.  The past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon.  And since the Party is in full control of all records, and in equally full control of the minds of its members, it follows that the past is whatever they Party chooses to make it.

Multimedia documents, digital video and sound can also be digital records, but these remained outside the scope of this study.\n\n\u00b6  An important difference compared to paper records is the greater loss of information that can occur even while the records are being used, or afterwards when the records are being maintained. After all, hard discs and computers are replaced regularly and there are few barriers to destroying computer files.

A little over ten years ago, several public and private repositories routinely fumigated materials that were even remotely suspected of mold or insect infestation. For example, the U.S. National Archives subjected all incoming records to ethylene oxide fumigation as a precautionary measure for several decades. Now we know that ethylene oxide can be deadly not just for mold and insects, but also for us if it is not used within accepted limits.  "

Iron gall ink was also easily made; the ingredients were inexpensive and readily available. Good quality iron gall ink was also stable in light.

Most 19th-century stereographs were albumen prints on cards measuring 3\u215c \u00d7 7 inches, although stereographs were made using other formats.  Most 20th century stereographs used gelatin silver prints on cards the same size.  Stereographs are commonly viewed in a special viewer that displays the left image to the left eye and the right image to the right eye."

That is, if r1 and r2 are the (absolute) rates of deterioration of a specific paper under two sets of temperature and relative humidity conditions we shall not deal with r1 and r2 individually but only with their ratio r2/r1 which measures the relative change in the deterioration rate resulting from the change in environmental conditions.\n\n  "

While the normal practice of the NA is to acquire electronic records into our custody, some specified categories of electronic records will be 'left out' under the control of their creators, and indeed perhaps left there for a very long time. Ultimately, however, if the agency goes defunct, or no longer operates the system, or maintains records in it for any sort of operational use, the NA would assume custody.  "

Many archives arrange records only to the folder level, although some archives arrange the items within each folder.  Arrangement is often combined with the process of rehousing materials into archival containers and folders, and includes the labeling and shelving of materials. Though not widely practiced, arrangement can be employed in an intellectual sense, without a corresponding physical ordering of material.  For example, five folders stored in four different boxes can be listed together in a finding aid as an ordered series without changing their storage location. ", 
      "Arrangement with respect to original order presumes such an order is discernable.  Archivists are not required to preserve 'original chaos', and may arrange such materials in a way that facilitates their use and management without violation of any archival principle. ",

Archivists make the distinction between an archival fonds, where the items are of known provenance and their arrangement reflects their original working order as the records of an organisation or individual, and an 'artificial collection,' where the items are associated but lack the coherence of a fonds. The archivist recognises the fonds as the set of items that have been created and accumulated by an identifiable individual body (or bodies). However, it should be emphasised that both these classes of aggregates (the fonds and the artificial collection) are 'collections' in the more general sense in which the term is used here. Within an archival fonds, an item can be fully understood only within the context of its relationship with other items and aggregates in the fonds, and descriptive practice reflects this.  "

When a greasy ink is applied, the water-soaked areas resist the ink, and the greasy image areas accept the ink.  The design is then transferred to paper in a press.  The original printing surfaces were made from limestone.  Offset lithography using flexible metal plates is a modern variation of the process."

Functional preservation goes further: the file does change over time so that the material continues to be immediately usable in the same way it was originally while the digital formats (and the physical media) evolve over time.

      "Most traditional photographic processes use a silver halide as the light-sensitive material, although light-sensitive salts of copper, iron, and uranium have been used as well.  The silver halide is reduced to metallic silver in black-and-white photographs and is used to form a dye in color photographs.  In the 19th century, collodion was commonly used as a binder for negatives, prints, ambrotypes, and tintypes, and albumen was the most common binder for prints.  Most modern photographic processes use gelatin to bind the silver halide to a film, paper, or glass support.  ", 
      "Technically, a photograph1 is distinguished from a print1, in which the image is formed mechanically rather than photochemically.  However, print3 is commonly used to describe images originally made with a camera but reproduced using a photomechanical process, such as a halftone or a Woodburytype.  Such images were, at some point, a photograph before reproduction.  However, digital photographs now capture and record images that are printed using a nonphotographic print process."

Although the setting and depth of vision that are chosen already imply a certain voluntary or arbitrary selection, the photographic lens perceives and records the space in a homogeneous manner and it is this global view that can provide us with useful information, sometimes capturing details not even intended by the photographer himself.

Ever since Paul Delaroche purportedly exclaimed, 'From today, painting is dead,' the photograph has been perceived as an objective record of reality, the product of a mechanical and therefore neutral means of documentation. . . .  Photographs derive the authority of their content from realism and accuracy, what J. B. Harley calls 'talismans' of authority; archival photographs convey their message through function and context. . . . The photograph is neither truth nor reality, but a representation willed into existence for a purpose and mediated by the persons concurring in its formation.  "

The life cycle model argues that there are clearly definable stages in record-keeping and creates a sharp distinction between current and historical record-keeping. The record continuum, on the other hand, has provided Australian records managers and archivists with a way of thinking about the integration of record-keeping and archiving processes.\n\n\u00b6  The life cycle model sees records passing through stages until they eventually 'die', except for the 'chosen ones' that are reincarnated as archives. A continuum-based approach suggests integrated time-space dimensions. Records are 'fixed' in time and space from the moment of their creation, but record-keeping regimes carry them forward and enable their use for multiple purposes by delivering them to people living in different times and spaces.

Such aspects, properties, or characteristics are called facets of a class or subject, a term introduced into classification theory and given this new meaning by the Indian librarian and classificationist S. R. Ranganathan and first used in his Colon Classification in the early 1930s.  Although the term was then new to classification, the idea was not (as Ranganathan freely admitted).  It had its roots in Dewey's device of place (location) as using a standard number (e.g., the United States always being 73) appended to any subject number by means of digits 09, a device now known as a facet indicator.

In its simplest implementation two forms are possible: dependency on the application, but not on the operating system; independency of both the operating system and the application.  "

      "Computers1 are often categorized  in terms of their processing power.  'Mainframe' (in slang, 'big iron') refers to large computers, especially older systems that relied on batch or centralized processing.  They continue to be used for applications that require many individuals to work simultaneously with a large amount of shared data, such as a large corporate accounting system.  Because 'mainframe' describes older systems, the term 'supercomputer' was introduced to describe a new class of very powerful computers, especially very fast or massively-parallel architectures.  'Minicomputer' was used to describe smaller systems, especially those with all components contained in a single cabinet. The term has generally fallen out of use.  'Microcomputer' and 'personal computer' (PC) are near synonyms that refer to small systems that rely on a single-chip central processing unit (CPU).   'Workstation' connotes a very powerful microcomputer designed for use by an individual for processor-intensive applications but is often used to mean any personal computer.  Given the increase of speed and capacity of hardware, the distinctions between these categories of computers are significantly blurred by the fact that many modern laptops are more powerful than early mainframes.  Modern computers are digital, using binary code and programmed using software.  Some early computers did not use binary code, and analog computers were programmed by physical wiring. ", 
      "Computer2 is now largely obsolete, though the profession was not uncommon through the mid-20th century.  Computers might have been involved in producing large tables of numbers from formulas."

      "Typically used to describe photographic, film, and video processes that render scenes by representing the brightness of objects as white, black, and intermediate tones.  In common parlance, the phrase is used to describe any image that fails to capture natural color, although the image may have a distinct, single tone.  In its strictest sense, 'black and white' is limited to those images that represent brightness in shades of gray, as distinguished from monochrome processes.  For example, cyanotypes are monochromatic, but because of their distinctive blue shade are not accurately described as 'black and white.'"

      "Because the key used to decrypt a message cannot be deduced from the key used to encode a message, the encoding key can be made public.  Anyone can use an individual's public key to encrypt a message that only the individual can decrypt using the private key. Public key cryptography was a breakthrough because it was the first technology that not require keys be exchanged in advance.  Two individuals, each with their own public and private keys, can send each other messages that are completely confidential.  Alice sends Bob messages using Bob's public key; only Bob has the key to decrypt and read her messages.  Bob sends Alice messages using Alice's public key; only Alice has the private key to read his messages.", 
      "Public key cryptography can be used to authenticate the sender of a message.  A message encoded with the private key can be decrypted with the public key.  If Alice receives an encrypted message that can be read with Bob's public key and if she has confidence that the public key is Bob's, then she can have equal confidence that the message is from Bob.  A certificate authority serves as a trusted third party to give Alice confidence in Bob's public key."

One would be able to do the job of scrambling a plaintext message \u2013 performing the task in such a way that outsiders couldn't read it \u2013 but a secret trapdoor would be built into the message. The other portion of the key pair was like a latch that could spring open that trapdoor and let its holder read the message. And here was the beauty of the scheme: yes, that second key \u2013 the one that flipped open the trapdoor \u2013 was of course something that had to be kept under wraps, safe form the prying hand of potential eavesdroppers. But its mate, the key that actually performed the encryption, didn't have to be a secret at all. In fact, you wouldn't want it to be secret. You'd be happy to see it distributed far and wide.  "

Primary values are those reflecting the basic business purpose(s) served by the records, the reason they were created. Secondary values reflect other uses to which the information may be put during the course of their life cycle, uses that may justify continuing retention after the expiration of primary values. Administrative or operational values are usually identified as primary values. Research or historical values are generally designated as secondary values. Legal value can be either a primary or a secondary value, depending on the purpose and function of a record. A records series can (and usually does) possess several of these values simultaneously, and they may change during a record's life cycle.  "

The Johns Hopkins Variorum Edition of Edmund Spenser, for instance, includes notes not only by that edition's editors, but by dozens of earlier critics, going back to the eighteenth century: for any passage in Spenser, the reader can see what earlier commentators have had to say about it.\n\n\u00b6  Other variorum editions reproduce not critical commentary but textual variants and conjectural emendations proposed by many other editors. The Arden Shakespeare, for example, gives the readings in all the important early witnesses (the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century quartos and folios), and, when they're relevant, the readings proposed by editors from the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries.

The most important of all principles of Archive Management is named from it le respect pour les fonds. . . . A fonds is an organic whole and that any Administration, or one or more of its fonctionnaires, can create a fonds d'archives provided that these include r\u00e9solutions or proc\u00e8s-verbaux; the inclusion of archives of such a type making it autonome. Roughly speaking, we may take it that they would make the qualities of a fonds d'archives depend on its including those which, when the administration which created it was active, constituted the final authority for executive action. For our purposes we may do better perhaps to represent this quality in terms of Administration rather than terms of documents, the forms of which are not necessarily constant.  Fonds we may render, for lack of a better translation, Archive Group, and define this as the Archives resulting from the work of an Administration which was an organic whole, complete in itself, capable of dealing independently, without any added or external authority, with every side of any business which could normally be presented to it.  This, it may be said, is to make the Archive Group a division much wider, much less strictly defined that the Fonds.  "

Codd, father of the relational database, and his associates have produced a white paper listing the 12 rules for OLAP (on-line analytical processing) systems. The list is fundamentally a formula for a successful information system, whether you call it an EIS, a DSS, or a business information system. \u00b6  \n 1. Multidimensional conceptual view. This supports EIS 'slice-and-dice'\n    operations and is usually required in financial modeling. \u2013 \n 2. Transparency. OLAP systems should be part of an open system that\n    supports heterogeneous data sources. Furthermore, the end user should\n    not have to be concerned about the details of data access or conversions. \u2013 \n 3. Accessibility. The OLAP should present the\n user with a single logical schema of the data.  \u2013 \n 4. Consistent reporting performance. Performance should not degrade\n    as the number of dimensions in the model increases.  \u2013 \n 5. Client/server architecture. Requirement for open, modular systems. \u2013 \n 6. Generic dimensionality. Not limited to 3-D and not biased toward\n    any particular dimension. A function applied to one dimension\n    should also be able to be applied to another. \u2013 \n 7. Dynamic sparse-matrix handling. Related both to the idea of nulls\n    in relational databases and to the notion of compressing large files,\n    a sparse matrix is one in which not every cell contains data. OLAP\n    systems should accommodate varying storage and data-handling options. \u2013 \n 8. Multiuser support. OLAP systems, like EISes, need to support\n    multiple concurrent users, including their individual views or\n    slices of a common database. \u2013 \n 9. Unrestricted cross-dimensional operations. Similar to rule 6; all\n    dimensions are created equal, and operations across data dimensions\n    do not restrict relationships between cells. \u2013 \n10. Intuitive data manipulation. Ideally, users shouldn't have to use\n    menus or perform complex multiple-step operations when an intuitive\n    drag-and-drop action will do. \u2013 \n11. Flexible reporting. Save a tree. Users should be able to print just\n    what they need, and any changes to the underlying financial model\n    should be automatically reflected in reports. \u2013 \n12. Unlimited dimensional and aggregation levels. A serious tool\n    should support at least 15, and preferably 20, dimensions.  "

It is particularly intended for representing metadata about Web resources, such as the title, author, and modification date of a Web page, copyright and licensing information about a Web document, or the availability schedule for some shared resource. However, by generalizing the concept of a 'Web resource', RDF can also be used to represent information about things that can be identified on the Web, even when they cannot be directly retrieved on the Web. Examples include information about items available from on-line shopping facilities (e.g., information about specifications, prices, and availability), or the description of a Web user's preferences for information delivery.\n\n\u00b6  RDF is intended for situations in which this information needs to be processed by applications, rather than being only displayed to people. RDF provides a common framework for expressing this information so it can be exchanged between applications without loss of meaning.  "

The organic nature or interrelationship results from the materials' functional relationships to one another within and outside each given fonds.  Impartiality describes records as a means for carrying out activities they document. Authenticity relates to records with their creator.

      "See narrower terms for more specific definitions of different types of records. The use of the general term 'record' when referring to a particular type of record inevitably leads to confusion because attributes of the particular type are not conveyed by the general term. In particular, the legal definition of record may change, depending on relevant laws, rules, and regulations.  The general legal definition of public records is established in the Federal Records Act (44 USC 3301, cited below), but 'record' is defined for different purposes in the Privacy Act (5 USC \u00a7 552(a), cited below).   See also business record, which is defined in the Rules of Federal Evidence. ", 
      "Records are not synonymous with archives. While an archives collects records, not all records merit ongoing preservation.", 
      "'Record' connotes documents, rather than artifacts or published materials, although collections of records may contain artifacts and books.  To the extent that records are defined in terms of their function rather than their characteristics, the definition is stretched to include many materials not normally understood to be a record; an artifact may function as a record, even though it falls outside the vernacular understanding of the definition.", 
      "A record1, 2, 3 has fixed content, structure, and context.  ", 
      "Content is the text, data, symbols, numerals, images, sound, graphics, and other information that make up the substance of the record.  A record's ability to fix information so that it can be repeated, recited, or recalled at a later date functions as an extension of memory and is at the heart of the concept of record.  A record may be created specifically to preserve information over time or to prevent future misinterpretation of that information, although a record cannot be presumed to be reliable without authentication.  However, any item - no matter how ephemeral it was intended to be - may serve as a record if it is later used as evidence of the thing to which it refers.", 
      "Fixity is the quality of content being stable and resisting change.  To preserve memory effectively, record content must be consistent over time.  Records made on mutable media, such as electronic records, must be managed so that it is possible to demonstrate that the content has not degraded or been altered.  A record may be fixed without being static.  A computer program may allow a user to analyze and view data many different ways.  A database itself may be considered a record if the underlying data is fixed and the same analysis and resulting view remain the same over time.", 
      "Structure refers to a record's physical characteristics and internal organization of the contents.  Record structure is the form that makes the content tangible and intelligible.  Physical characteristics include components and methods of assembly, such as paper, ink, seals, and font families, or character sets, encoding, and file formats.  Structure also includes the intellectual organization of a document.  A record's structure may be very simple, such as plain text on a page; it may be organized into an outline or sections with headings; or it may be highly complex, including a preamble, the body, and the signatures of witnesses.", 
      "A document's structure is contained within boundaries, which define the record as a unit and give it identity by distinguishing it from other information.  A record may consist of many physically or logically discrete parts that function together as unit, such as several pages or data values from many tables.  However, those parts must be bound together in some fashion.", 
      "Context is the organizational, functional, and operational circumstances surrounding a record's creation, receipt, storage, or use.  Context includes a record's date and place of creation, compilation, or issue, and its relationship to other records.", 
      "Records may be in any format, including text, images, or sound.  However, the concept of record is ultimately independent of any specific carrier or format.  Paper records may be microfilmed, and electronic records may be transferred from memory to disk to paper.  ", 
      "A record is often unique, whereas a publication is always created in multiple copies.  However, a record may be a single copy of many that has been selected for preservation or special treatment (a record copy).  For example, a publisher may keep one copy of each publication as a record. ", 
      "Record2, 3 is sometimes used to mean the record copy or official record, the complete, final, and authoritative version that is preserved.  This sense of record is distinguished from nonrecord or document3, which includes copies of the official record or materials that are not scheduled and can be disposed of without authorization.", 
      "'Record' is frequently used synonymously with 'document'.  To the extent the vernacular uses 'record' to refer to any document, without specification, the terms are synonymous.  However, the concept of record is independent of format, and it includes things that are clearly not documents.  For example, an artifact may serve as a record if it is preserved to bolster human memory or to demonstrate accountability.", 
      "Records are sometimes distinguished from papers, with 'records' referring to items that were generated as the result of routine activities or a transactions, especially those of an organization.  'Papers' refer to documents created on a more or less ad hoc basis, especially those of an individual."

      "At its simplest, combination printing may be little more than the use of two separate negatives made of the landscape and the sky that are printed together.  This technique was used to compensate for orthochromatic negatives that could not properly record the sky and scenery in a single exposure.  At the other extreme, combination printing is frequently associated with the Pictorialist photographers of the 19th century. O. G. Rejlander and H. P. Robinson were two well-known practitioners.  One of the best known examples is Rejlander's The Two Ways of Life, described below.  A print made using this technique may be described as a combination print or a composite print."

Instead, he enlisted the services of a troupe of strolling players and photographed them in groups at scales appropriate to the distance at which they were to appear from the spectator. On other negatives he photographed models of the stage. He made thirty negatives in all, which he masked so they would fit together like a picture puzzle.  Then, painstakingly masking a sheet of sensitized paper to match each negative in turn, he printed them one after the other in the appropriate positions.  "

The Web trivialized this original Xanadu model, vastly but incorrectly simplifying these problems to a world of fragile ever-breaking one-way links, with no recognition of change or copyright, and no support for multiple versions or principled re-use.  Fonts and glitz, rather than content connective structure, prevail. \n\n\u00b6 Serious electronic literature (for scholarship, detailed controversy and detailed collaboration) must support bidirectional and profuse links, which cannot be embedded; and must offer facilities for easily tracking re-use on a principled basis among versions and quotations. \n\n\u00b6 Xanalogical literary structure is a unique symmetrical connective system for text (and other separable media elements), with two complementary forms of connection that achieve these functions \u2013 survivable deep linkage (content links) and recognizable, visible re-use (transclusion).

Some cases take the view that material gathered by way of preliminary investigation does not become a public record before some official action of approval or disapproval.  On the other hand, the drawing of a distinction between writings representing tentative action and those memorializing ultimate action has been regarded as objectionable, not only because it is inconsistent with the principle which underlies the statutes making public writings freely available for inspection, but also because it provides a device by which a public official can hinder a citizen's legitimate attempt to obtain writings which are clearly within the strictest definition of a public record.

This range might include a rigorous set of functional tests, performance testing, reliability testing, and so on, in which case the term verification, validation and testing  is more appropraite. Although a precise distinction is not always drawn, the verification aspects normally refers to completely objective checking of conforming to some well-defined specification, while the validation aspect normally refers to a somewhat objective assessment of likely suitability in the intended environment.

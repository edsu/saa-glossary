By determining how long it takes for materials in an environment with an elevated temperature to reach a predetermined level of deterioration (brittleness, fading, signal loss), it is possible to project how long it will take materials at normal storage conditions to reach that level of deterioration.  Because the level of deterioration is set arbitrarily, the test has a subjective aspect that makes results open to dispute.  For example, the test may accurately predict the time it will take film to reach a predicted level of brittleness, but some individuals would find the film to be sufficiently pliable to remain useful."

If we think of admissibility as a question of disclosure or nondisclosure, it us usually easy to say whether or not an item of evidence has been admitted.  When we consider the question of permissible use, the concept seems much more complicated. In the first place, evidence may be 'admissible' for one purpose but not for another. . . .  In the second place, questions of the permissible use of evidence do not arise only at the time of disclosure to the trier of fact. The court may have to consider admissibility in deciding whether to give the jury a limiting instruction, whether or not an opponent's rebuttal evidence is relevant, and whether or not counsel can argue to the jury that the evidence proves a particular point.

Is the elephant attached to the label or the label to the elephant? \u00b6 The answer to those who would put this dilemma to us in the present connexion is that the Administration would be obliged in all such cases to solve the question of housing \u2013 to send the spar to Kew Gardens or the elephant to the Zoo \u2013 long before the label or letter comes into charge of the Archivist: the problem is an Administrative, not an Archive one."

Some archival theorists, notably Jenkinson, argue that such decisions should not be made by archivists at all, but only by records creators.  In the United States, Schellenberg believed that appraisal was not only an appropriate archival function but an absolutely necessary one, in the face of increasing masses of documentation in the 20th century.  U.S. archival theory and practice has been rooted in Schellenberg's philosophy and teaching."

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the description and the item. The description is based on, and is derived from, the physical item. Archival description represents a fonds, a complex body of materials, frequently in more than one form or medium, sharing a common provenance. The description involves a complex hierarchical and progressive analysis. It begins by describing the whole, then proceeds to identify and describe sub-components of the whole, and sub-components of sub-components, and so on. Frequently, but by no means always, the description terminates with a description of individual items. The description emphasizes the intellectual structure and content of the material, rather than their physical characteristics."

        "Archivist Oliver Wendell Holmes identified five levels of arrangement: repository; collection or record group; series; folder; and item.  Many archives arrange records only to the folder level, although some archives arrange the items within each folder.  Arrangement is often combined with the process of rehousing materials into archival containers and folders, and includes the labeling and shelving of materials. Though not widely practiced, arrangement can be employed in an intellectual sense, without a corresponding physical ordering of material.  For example, five folders stored in four different boxes can be listed together in a finding aid as an ordered series without changing their storage location. ", 
        "Arrangement with respect to original order presumes such an order is discernable.  Archivists are not required to preserve 'original chaos', and may arrange such materials in a way that facilitates their use and management without violation of any archival principle. ",

Under such a policy, backup tapes and hard drives would not be governed by an inaccurate characterization of them as retention systems, but rather by a proper understanding of their role in providing for system reconstruction in the event of loss of functionality.\n\n[Note:] Unlike archival systems, which contemplate restoring data, in part or whole, to an existing, active system to be used along with other active data, backup systems are designed to completely restore active systems that have been lost or corrupted as the result of some disaster. Therefore, while data stored in offline archives may often be restored to the active system and searched, searching backup files often requires either taking active data off the system or 'cloning' the system.

The archivist recognises the fonds as the set of items that have been created and accumulated by an identifiable individual body (or bodies). However, it should be emphasised that both these classes of aggregates (the fonds and the artificial collection) are 'collections' in the more general sense in which the term is used here. Within an archival fonds, an item can be fully understood only within the context of its relationship with other items and aggregates in the fonds, and descriptive practice reflects this."

They continue to be used for applications that require many individuals to work simultaneously with a large amount of shared data, such as a large corporate accounting system.  Because 'mainframe' describes older systems, the term 'supercomputer' was introduced to describe a new class of very powerful computers, especially very fast or massively-parallel architectures.  'Minicomputer' was used to describe smaller systems, especially those with all components contained in a single cabinet. The term has generally fallen out of use.  'Microcomputer' and 'personal computer' (PC) are near synonyms that refer to small systems that rely on a single-chip central processing unit (CPU).   'Workstation' connotes a very powerful microcomputer designed for use by an individual for processor-intensive applications but is often used to mean any personal computer.  Given the increase of speed and capacity of hardware, the distinctions between these categories of computers are significantly blurred by the fact that many modern laptops are more powerful than early mainframes.  Modern computers are digital, using binary code and programmed using software.  Some early computers did not use binary code, and analog computers were programmed by physical wiring. ",

They remained common until the popularization of the ambrotype in 1854.  The surface is highly reflective.  The image appears as a positive when viewed while reflecting a dark background and as a negative when reflecting a light background.  The image is monochromatic, although color may have been added by hand.  Unless special camera optics were used, the image is laterally reversed.  The surface is fragile and may be tarnished.  To protect the image, a daguerreotype is almost always mounted under glass with a paper seal around the edge; most daguerreotypes are mounted in a hinged case."

Another data warehousing pioneer, Richard Hackathorn, describes the data warehouse as a single image of the business reality [citing Lambert].\n\n\u00b6  Data warehouses are becoming an increasingly popular tool for the management of data. The most fundamental reason for this is, firstly, that executives need rapid, easy access to data for planning and control. Secondly, data have historically been stored in disparate systems, in multiple locations, which made a complete view of organizational data almost impossible [citing Laudon & Laudon]."

Thus, no organisational view on data existed. These different data definitions also lead to inconsistent reports that cannot be used by management for decision making. In turn, the inconsistent reports cause users not to trust reports and organisational data. These problems were aggravated by the fact that data that went into the DSS systems were sometimes 'dirty' or inaccurate as there was no 'scrubbing' or cleansing process to ensure accurate data, presented in a uniform format. Lastly, data were shared reluctantly in business-unit-centric systems, and the data were not integrated, requiring complicated bridges to share data [citing Moss & Adelman 1999a]. The shortcomings of DSS systems became profound as the users of these systems changed from administrators at a tactical level to analysts and managers at the strategic level."

Deletion occurs in several levels on modern computer systems: (a) File level deletion: Deletion on the file level renders the file inaccessible to the operating system and normal application programs and marks the space occupied by the file's directory entry and contents as free space, available to reuse for data storage. (b) Record level deletion: Deletion on the record level occurs when a data structure, like a database table, contains multiple records; deletion at this level renders the record inaccessible to the database management system (DBMS) and usually marks the space occupied by the record as available for reuse by the DBMS, although in some cases the space is never reused until the database is compacted. Record level deletion is also characteristic of many e-mail systems. (c) Byte level deletion: Deletion at the byte level occurs when text or other information is deleted from the file content (such as the deletion of text from a word processing file); such deletion may render the deleted data inaccessible to the application intended to be used in processing the file, but may not actually remove the data from the file's content until a process such as compaction or rewriting of the file causes the deleted data to be overwritten."

They know it conflicts with the present and offers both intellectually and spiritually enriching perspectives on life.  In the other world, we see well-funded, slick, and often superficial presentations of the past that generally reflect a single harmonious, monolithic, and monocultural image, free from disturbing incidents or experiences that might engender the question of 'why.' \u00b6  The social appropriation of the past for commercial and political use is a complex phenomenon. One the one hand, it bolsters public interest in history and would seem beneficial to archives.  On the other hand, much of the mass market appeal of history seems to operate on a more superficial and sinister level.  There is a strong primary emphasis on the emotive appeal of the past; nostalgia and 'event experiences' are very much in contrast to documentary-based examinations of the past where the evidence can be removed and reexamined."

If the employee can view the information, it should be treated as the equivalent of a paper 'document.' Data that can be readily compiled into information, whether presented on the screen or printed on paper, is also a 'document' under Rule 34. [Note: Fed. R. Civ. P.] However, data used by a computer system but hidden and never revealed to the user in the ordinary course of business should not be presumptively treated as a 'document.' Nor should data that is not accessible except through forensic means, such as deleted or residual data."

And we understand that the greatest educational value comes from archives not as a source for images of the past but as the font of evidence.  Where we particularly should be taking issue with the mass media use of the past is when it is used for escapism from the present.

The effect was to stop for twenty years the addition of any published work to the public domain.  As Roy Rosenzweig noted in a recent article in the Journal of American History, '[f]or historians, copyright protection has redlined . . . much twentieth-century history. . . .'  In response, a group of publishers and preservationists filed suit challenging the constitutionality of copyright term extension.  The suit, Eldred v. Ashcroft, argues that 'perpetual copyright on the installment plan' is in direct violation of the constitutional stipulation that the monopoly rights granted by copyright be for a limited term.  The suit has lost in the Federal Appeals court, and recently the plaintiffs asked the Supreme Court to rule on the issue. \u00b6  A coalition of information organizations, including the Society of American Archivists, the Association of Research Libraries, the American Library Association, the Digital Futures Coalition, and others have filed an amicus brief with the Court asking that they hear the case.  The brief notes the irreparable harm done to historians and institutions that exploit the public domain when copyright term is excessive."

Whereas the purpose of an EIS is the monitoring and scanning of the environment to give executives rapid exposure to changes in the environment, the purpose of Decision Support Systems (DSS) is to support ad hoc decisions as well as routine analysis. And while the core of DSS is extensive modeling and analysis capabilities, the core of EIS is status information about the organization's performance. Expert Systems use artificial intelligence to go beyond basic decision support."

Such aspects, properties, or characteristics are called facets of a class or subject, a term introduced into classification theory and given this new meaning by the Indian librarian and classificationist S. R. Ranganathan and first used in his Colon Classification in the early 1930s.  Although the term was then new to classification, the idea was not (as Ranganathan freely admitted).  It had its roots in Dewey's device of place (location) as using a standard number (e.g., the United States always being 73) appended to any subject number by means of digits 09, a device now known as a facet indicator."

A fonds is an organic whole and that any Administration, or one or more of its fonctionnaires, can create a fonds d'archives provided that these include r\u00e9solutions or proc\u00e8s-verbaux; the inclusion of archives of such a type making it autonome. Roughly speaking, we may take it that they would make the qualities of a fonds d'archives depend on its including those which, when the administration which created it was active, constituted the final authority for executive action. For our purposes we may do better perhaps to represent this quality in terms of Administration rather than terms of documents, the forms of which are not necessarily constant.  Fonds we may render, for lack of a better translation, Archive Group, and define this as the Archives resulting from the work of an Administration which was an organic whole, complete in itself, capable of dealing independently, without any added or external authority, with every side of any business which could normally be presented to it.  This, it may be said, is to make the Archive Group a division much wider, much less strictly defined that the Fonds."

Most often, incoming records are housed in modern office-quality folders and boxes that meet short-term rather than long-term retention requirements. \n\n\u00b6  With these points in mind, a holdings maintenance program has three major procedural objectives: \nto place documents into a good primary housing (a container that fully encloses them, supports them, and protects them from the environment); \nwithin the container, to group documents into folders for additional protection and support and to enhance safe access; \nto place documents that are severely damaged or vulnerable into individual enclosures. \n\n\u00b6  Also defined in a holdings maintenance program are the four functional, design, and compositional features of the housing supplies \u2013 the containers, folders, and sleeves \u2013 used during the course of work: \nhousings and enclosures must perform their assigned function; \nthey must be as simple and straightforward to use as possible to facilitate easy and safe access to the documents; \nthey must not contain any structural features that will physically damage or jeopardize the documents; \nthey must be made of stable materials that will not contribute to the deterioration of the documents in the present or the future."

Hypermedia is a method of structuring information in a mixture of media (text, video, graphics) in such a way that related items of information are connected together by links or threads called hyperlinks; hypertext is machine-readable text that forms an interconnected structure in a similar way. . . . The term hypermedia is frequently treated as a synonym for the related term multimedia; however, multimedia presentations can be linear and non-interactive, whereas hypermedia ones necessitate decisions by the user to select one route through the presentation over another."

The information content of any physical objects, or logical data, cannot be measured or discussed until it is known what range of possibilities existed before and after they were received. The information lies in the reduction in uncertainty resulting from the receipt of the objects or the data, and not in the size of complexity of the objects or data themselves. Questions of the form, function, and semantic import of data are only relevant to information inasmuch as they contribute to the reduction of uncertainty.

These factors included not only the well known litany of pesticide misuse problems (resistance and non-target effects), but also the rapid development of technologies enabling more sophisticated approaches, primarily due to rapid advances in communication and computing, with the allied new sciences of operations research, systems analysis, and modeling.  \u00b6 \n\nAlthough much of the initial push for IPM came from California researchers in sympathetic response to Rachael Carson's Silent Spring, national acceptance of IPM as a philosophy and technology can be traced to 1970 to the first symposium of agricultural scientists brought together to discuss IPM in a conference held at North Carolina State University, which was jointly funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, NSF, and USDA/CSRS."

This does not mean that the record must be precisely the same as it was when first created for its integrity to exist and be demonstrated. When we refer to an electronic record, we consider it essentially complete and uncorrupted if the message that it is meant to communicate in order to achieve its purpose is unaltered. This implies that its physical integrity, such as the proper number of bit strings, may be compromised, provided that the articulation of the content and any required elements of form remain the same. The integrity of a record may be demonstrated by evidence found on the face of the record, in metadata related to the record, or in one or more of its various contexts."

The InterPARES Project is based in the School of Library, Archival and Information Studies at the University of British Columbia.\n\n\u00b6  The first phase of the project, InterPARES 1, began in 1999 and was concluded in 2001. It focused on the preservation of the authenticity of records that are no longer needed by the creating body to fulfill its own mission or purposes. This phase has produced conceptual requirements for authenticity, models of the processes of selection and preservation of authentic electronic records, a glossary, and other reports."

On the basis of this understanding, the project will formulate methodologies for ensuring that the records created using these systems can be trusted as to their content (that is, are reliable and accurate) and as records (that is, are authentic) while used by the creator; for selecting those that have to be kept for legal, administrative, social or cultural reasons after they are no longer needed by the creator; for preserving them in authentic form over the long term; and for analyzing and evaluating advanced technologies for the implementation of these methodologies in a way that respects cultural diversity and pluralism."

Iron gall ink was also easily made; the ingredients were inexpensive and readily available. Good quality iron gall ink was also stable in light.

That is, if r1 and r2 are the (absolute) rates of deterioration of a specific paper under two sets of temperature and relative humidity conditions we shall not deal with r1 and r2 individually but only with their ratio r2/r1 which measures the relative change in the deterioration rate resulting from the change in environmental conditions."

Therefore, it's up to individual companies to determine what information qualifies as intellectual and knowledge-based assets. In general, however, intellectual and knowledge-based assets fall into one of two categories: explicit or tacit. Included among the former are assets such as patents, trademarks, business plans, marketing research and customer lists. As a general rule of thumb, explicit knowledge consists of anything that can be documented, archived and codified, often with the help of IT. Much harder to grasp is the concept of tacit knowledge, or the know-how contained in people's heads. The challenge inherent with tacit knowledge is figuring out how to recognize, generate, share and manage it. While IT in the form of e-mail, groupware, instant messaging and related technologies can help facilitate the dissemination of tacit knowledge, identifying tacit knowledge in the first place is a major hurdle for most organizations."

As the technology came into common use, a screw-powered letter press was used in conjunction with a press book, a bound volume of blank, tissue paper pages.  A letter freshly written in special copying ink was placed on a dampened page while the rest of the pages were protected by oilcloths.  The book was then closed and the mechanical press screwed down tightly.  The pressure and moisture caused an impression of the letter to be retained on the underside of the tissue sheet.  This impression could then be read through the top of the thin paper. \u00b6 These letter presses were used by some individuals and businessmen in the first half of the nineteenth century, but they only came into general use in the second half of the century. \u00b6 A letter press reduced the labor cost, both by decreasing copying time and by allowing an office boy to do the copying once performed by a more expensive clerk.  As the same time, it eliminated the danger of miscopying.  Copies were now facsimiles of the letter sent, down to the signature."

This model portrays the life of a record as going through various stages or periods, much like a living organism. In stage one, the record is created, presumably for a legitimate reason and according to certain standards. In the second stage, the record goes through an active period when it has maximum primary value and is used or referred to frequently by the creating office and others involved in decision making. During this time the record is stored on-site in the active or current files of the creating office. At the end of stage two the record may be reviewed and determined to have no further value, at which point it is destroyed, or the record can enter stage three, where it is relegated to a semi-active status, which means it still has value, but is not needed for day-to-day decision making. Because the record need not be consulted regularly, it is often stored in a off-site storage center. At the end of stage three, another review occurs, at which point a determination is made to destroy or send the record to stage four, which is reserved for inactive records with long-term, indefinite, archival value. This small percentage of records (normally estimated at approximately five per cent of the total documentation) is sent to an archival repository, where specific activities are undertaken to preserve and describe the records.\n\n\u00b6 The life cycle model not only describes what will happen to a record, it also defines who will manage the record during each stage. During the creation and active periods, the record creators have primary responsibility for managing the record, although records managers may well be involved to various degrees. In the semi-active stage, it is the records manager who takes center stage and assumes major responsibility for managing the records. Finally, in the inactive stage, the archivist takes the lead in preserving, describing, and providing access to the archival record."

The LOCKSS model enforces the publisher's access control systems and, for many publishers, does no harm to their business models. \n\n\u00b6  Accuracy and completeness of LOCKSS caches are assured through a peer-to-peer polling and reputation system (operated through LCAP, LOCKSS' communication protocol), which is both robust and secure. LOCKSS replicas cooperate to detect and repair preservation failures. LOCKSS is designed to run on inexpensive hardware and to require almost no technical administration.

This adaptation has become increasingly common in recent years, as the special MARC AMC format was eliminated in favor of a single bibliographic format for MARC records that describes all formats of materials and the underlying and unifying principles that can be used to describe both published and unpublished materials.  The introduction of Encoded Archival Description as an electronic standard for displaying finding aids on the World Wide Web has not diminished the importance of bibliographic cataloging, especially in institutions with collections including archives, published material, and other formats."

In its search for an ideal mass deacidification process, the Library invented and further developed the diethyl zinc (DEZ) gaseous process and also brought about key improvements in solvent-based, liquid phase processes. In the conservation science community, gaseous processes have traditionally been deemed to have a significant edge over liquid phase, solvent-based processes, mainly because they preclude any possibility of adverse effects on inks, dyes and colored pigments in manuscripts, color plates and book covers due to bleeding or softening of inks."

The copyright laws of the United States grant certain rights to copyright owners for the protection of their works of authorship. Among these rights is the right to make, and to authorize others to make, a reproduction of the copyrighted work, and the right to distribute, and to authorize others to distribute, the copyrighted work. Both the reproduction right and the distribution right granted to a copyright owner inhere in all works of authorship and are, for the most part, exclusive rights. However, for copyright holders of nondramatic musical works, the exclusivity of the reproduction right and distribution right are limited by the compulsory license of section 115 of the Copyright Act. Often referred to as the 'mechanical license,' section 115 grants third parties a nonexclusive license to make and distribute phonorecords of nondramatic musical works. The license can be invoked once a nondramatic musical work embodied in a phonorecord is distributed 'to the public in the United States under the authority of the copyright owner.' 17 U.S.C. 115(a)(1). Unless and until such an act occurs, the copyright owner's rights in the musical work remain exclusive, and the compulsory license does not apply. Once it does occur, the license permits anyone to make and distribute phonorecords of the musical work provided, of course, that they comply with all of the royalty and accounting requirements of section 115. It is important to note that the mechanical license only permits the making and distribution of phonorecords of a musical work, and does not permit the use of a sound recording created by someone else. The compulsory licensee must either assemble his own musicians, singers, recording engineers and equipment, or obtain permission from the copyright owner to use a preexisting sound recording. One who obtains permission to use another's sound recording is eligible to use the compulsory license for the musical composition that is performed on the sound recording. The mechanical license was the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law, having its origin in the 1909 Copyright Act. It operated successfully for many years, and it continued under the 1976 Copyright Act with only some technical modifications. However, in 1995, Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act ('Digital Performance Act'), Public Law 104-39, 109 Stat. 336, which amended sections 114 and 115 of the Copyright Act to take account of technological changes which were beginning to enable digital transmission of sound recordings. With respect to section 115, the Act expanded the scope of the mechanical license to include the right to distribute, or authorize the distribution of, a phonorecord by means of a digital transmission which constitutes a 'digital phonorecord delivery.'"

For diplomatists examining medieval documents, the medium is an essential component of a record because the examination of the physical carrier on which the document is inscribed is one of the most obvious proofs of its authenticity.  In the translation of diplomatic concepts into the modern, paper-based, recordkeeping environments, the medium has continued to be treated as a part of the record itself, mainly because the medium and the message are inextricably linked. \u00b6  The question was whether, in an electronic recordkeeping environment, the medium should continue to be treated as an essential part of the record itself given that 1) the medium and the message are no longer inextricably linked; 2) what is inscribed on or affixed to the medium is not a record as such (or words, or pictures), but a bitstream; and 3) the choice of a medium by those creating or maintaining the record is often arbitrary and carries no particular significance."

The conventions of letter writing were well established.  These included the date of writing, a formal salutation ('Dear . . . ') as well as a formal closing ('Your most . . .') . . . As the letter was increasingly used for internal communication, within and across departments, the new business experts, masters of efficiency, argued for a much simplified format.  Typing time could be saved if the company printed up letterheads with fields such as To, From, and Subject, and if openings and closings were stripped down to a bare minimum. . . . \u00b6 . . . The 'Subject' field had a double purpose.  It of course gave the recipient a quick way to determine what the memo was about.

          "quotation": "\u2020(METS 2003) Maintaining a library of digital objects of necessity requires maintaining metadata about those objects. The metadata necessary for successful management and use of digital objects is both more extensive than and different from the metadata used for managing collections of printed works and other physical materials. While a library may record descriptive metadata regarding a book in its collection, the book will not dissolve into a series of unconnected pages if the library fails to record structural metadata regarding the book's organization, nor will scholars be unable to evaluate the book's worth if the library fails to note that the book was produced using a Ryobi offset press. The same cannot be said for a digital version of the same book. Without structural metadata, the page image or text files comprising the digital work are of little use, and without technical metadata regarding the digitization process, scholars may be unsure of how accurate a reflection of the original the digital version provides. For internal management purposes, a library must have access to appropriate technical metadata in order to periodically refresh and migrate the data, ensuring the durability of valuable resources.\n\n\u00b6  The Making of America II project (MOA2) attempted to address these issues in part by providing an encoding format for descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata for textual and image-based works. METS, a Digital Library Federation initiative, attempts to build upon the work of MOA2 and provide an XML document format for encoding metadata necessary for both management of digital library objects within a repository and exchange of such objects between repositories (or between repositories and their users). Depending on its use, a METS document could be used in the role of Submission Information Package (SIP), Archival Information Package (AIP), or Dissemination Information Package (DIP) within the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model."

The strategy they propose includes: defining a collecting area; analyzing existing collections; determining the documentary universe, including relevant government records, printed and other sources; prioritizing industrial sectors, individual businesses, geographic regions, and time periods from which records will be sought; defining functions performed by businesses and the collecting levels needed to document major functions; connecting documentary levels to priority tiers; and updating this process every three to seven years. They outline priority factors used in making these decisions, documentation levels, and decision points to refine the priority levels. This Minnesota Method combines features of archival approaches to collection analysis, documentation strategy, appraisal, and functional analysis."

An author is said to have the \"moral right\" to control her work. The concept of moral rights thus relies on the connection between an author and her creation. Moral rights protect the personal and reputational, rather than purely monetary, value of a work to its creator. . . . \n\n\u00b6  In the U.S., moral rights are primarily protected by VARA. Before VARA was passed, courts and commentators struggled to find moral rights in the \"derivative work\" provision of the Copyright Act, the laws of defamation, the rights of privacy and publicity, the doctrine of misappropriation, and especially the Lanham Act, which deals with trademarks and unfair competition.  Authors may seek moral rights protection from state moral rights laws and art preservation statutes in California and New York, whose provisions resemble those of VARA. Authors whose works are not covered by VARA and the state statutes may also seek moral rights-type protection from various other sources of law."

To Australians, it is important to note that the National Archives of Canada has not adopted a non-custodial or distributed custody approach in toto, but neither has it rejected such an approach. . . . While the normal practice of the NA is to acquire electronic records into our custody, some specified categories of electronic records will be 'left out' under the control of their creators, and indeed perhaps left there for a very long time. Ultimately, however, if the agency goes defunct, or no longer operates the system, or maintains records in it for any sort of operational use, the NA would assume custody."

          "quotation": "\u2020(McCullagh and Caelli 2000) There is a definitional distinction between the legal use of the term 'non-repudiation' and its crypto-technical use. In the legal sense an alleged signatory to a document is always able to repudiate a signature that has been attributed to him or her. The basis for a repudiation of a traditional signature may include: \nThe signature is a forgery; \nThe signature is not a forgery, but was obtained via\n  unconscionable conduct by a party to a transaction,  \n  fraud instigated by a third party, \n  undue influence exerted by a third party.  \n\n\u00b6 There appears to be a movement within the electronic commerce environment to take away these fundamental rights that exist within common law jurisdictions. The general rule of evidence is that if a person denies a particular signature then it falls upon the relying party to prove that the signature is truly that of the person denying it. It should be understood that the term 'deny' and the term 'repudiate' are synonymous and this position is supported by standard dictionary definitions. \n\n\u00b6  Furthermore, the common law trust mechanism established to overcome a false claim of non-repudiation is witnessing. Witnessing simply occurs at the time the signature is being affixed. That is, by having an independent adult witness the signing of a document reduces the ability of the signatory to successfully deny the signature as a forgery at a later date. It is always open for the signatory to deny the signature on other grounds such as those enumerated above.  [Citations omitted.]"

Codd, father of the relational database, and his associates have produced a white paper listing the 12 rules for OLAP (on-line analytical processing) systems. The list is fundamentally a formula for a successful information system, whether you call it an EIS, a DSS, or a business information system. \u00b6  \n 1. Multidimensional conceptual view. This supports EIS 'slice-and-dice'\n    operations and is usually required in financial modeling. \u2013 \n 2. Transparency. OLAP systems should be part of an open system that\n    supports heterogeneous data sources. Furthermore, the end user should\n    not have to be concerned about the details of data access or conversions. \u2013 \n 3. Accessibility. The OLAP should present the\n user with a single logical schema of the data.  \u2013 \n 4. Consistent reporting performance. Performance should not degrade\n    as the number of dimensions in the model increases.  \u2013 \n 5. Client/server architecture. Requirement for open, modular systems. \u2013 \n 6. Generic dimensionality. Not limited to 3-D and not biased toward\n    any particular dimension. A function applied to one dimension\n    should also be able to be applied to another. \u2013 \n 7. Dynamic sparse-matrix handling. Related both to the idea of nulls\n    in relational databases and to the notion of compressing large files,\n    a sparse matrix is one in which not every cell contains data. OLAP\n    systems should accommodate varying storage and data-handling options. \u2013 \n 8. Multiuser support. OLAP systems, like EISes, need to support\n    multiple concurrent users, including their individual views or\n    slices of a common database. \u2013 \n 9. Unrestricted cross-dimensional operations. Similar to rule 6; all\n    dimensions are created equal, and operations across data dimensions\n    do not restrict relationships between cells. \u2013 \n10. Intuitive data manipulation. Ideally, users shouldn't have to use\n    menus or perform complex multiple-step operations when an intuitive\n    drag-and-drop action will do. \u2013 \n11. Flexible reporting. Save a tree. Users should be able to print just\n    what they need, and any changes to the underlying financial model\n    should be automatically reflected in reports. \u2013 \n12. Unlimited dimensional and aggregation levels. A serious tool\n    should support at least 15, and preferably 20, dimensions."

        "Open1 is the opposite of closed, restricted, or classified. - Within computing, open2-5 has many meanings that vary with context and use.  In general, it is used as an antonym of closed, which refers to proprietary software and hardware that is a black box to all but the developer.  A closed system has defined inputs and outputs, but without additional information about the system it is impossible to make that system do anything else.  An open system exposes its internal workings, allowing others to understand how the system works.  In principle, others can then interact with, modify, or add to the system.  In practice, licensing agreements may restrict what can be done with an open system.  For example, it may be permissible to build components that connect to an open hardware system, but not to reproduce the system itself."

However, this is an all-too-broad definition that puts Microsoft's .NET in the same camp as Java \u2013 since there are millions of developers for each of those platforms. For others, a standard is open only if a vendor-neutral third-party organization (or even governmental body) creates and manages it. However, this definition is too strict in that it excludes the term 'open source' from its meaning. Finally, many organizations consider a standard to be 'open' if the specification has merely been published for review."

Early carbon inks, which merely lay on the surface of the parchment, could be removed more or less completely simply by sponging, but the later iron gall inks were much more difficult to remove because of the interaction with the fibers of the tannin present in the ink. They had to be scraped and then treated with a weak acid, such as the citric acid of an orange. Even then traces of the original writing remained. Wetting the parchment in this manner softened it to such an extent that it was necessary to treat the skin with dry lime to make it dry and white once again.

A panorama was often painted on a cylindrical wall or on a long scroll. - Panorama2 is now used in a more general sense to refer to images that give a broad view of the landscape.  - In photography, panorama3 refers to a variety of formats.  Wide-field and banquet panoramas consist of a single frame with correct perspective.  Cirkut panoramas are made using a specialized camera that sweeps through an angle during exposure while scrolling the film to track against the camera motion.  Cirkut panoramas have distorted perspectives.  Mosaic panoramas are made by piecing together separate photographs, usually a standard-sized format; mosaic panoramas also have a distorted perspective."

The understanding was that it came from Xerox PARC. . . .

Memorials also express opposition to ('remonstrate against') some pending action. In modern usage, there is no apparent difference between a memorial and a petition, and petition has become the commonly accepted generic term. A similar document transmitted to Congress by a legislative body such as a State legislature takes the form of a resolution and is sometimes termed a memorial."

In the 19th century, collodion was commonly used as a binder for negatives, prints, ambrotypes, and tintypes, and albumen was the most common binder for prints.  Most modern photographic processes use gelatin to bind the silver halide to a film, paper, or glass support.  ",

However, print3 is commonly used to describe images originally made with a camera but reproduced using a photomechanical process, such as a halftone or a Woodburytype.  Such images were, at some point, a photograph before reproduction.  However, digital photographs now capture and record images that are printed using a nonphotographic print process."

Ever since Paul Delaroche purportedly exclaimed, 'From today, painting is dead,' the photograph has been perceived as an objective record of reality, the product of a mechanical and therefore neutral means of documentation. . . .  Photographs derive the authority of their content from realism and accuracy, what J. B.

Even when an unused print is stored in the dark though and when stored under the same conditions as a negative or intermediate element, it will fade more quickly."

        "Printing-out papers were prevalent from the invention of photography through most of the 19th century.  A negative was sandwiched between glass and a sheet of printing-out paper in a frame, and the whole was then placed in the sun.  The light slowly changed the silver halide to metallic silver. The photographer could monitor the printing progress in reduced light by pulling the paper away from the negative; if more exposure was needed, the sandwich was returned to sunlight to continue printing.  After exposure, the prints were fixed to halt further development.  Printing-out papers produce images that are a purplish brown and were usually toned to a purple black. Unfixed printing-out paper, often used for portrait proof prints, are often rust-colored and show signs of silver mirroring.  Eastman Kodak marketed printing-out paper under the name Studio Proof, intended specifically for portrait proofs."

But do we?  These sources tell us how administrative action was supposed to be carried out, rather than how it actually was carried out; they tell us what the procedures ought to be, what management expected to happen, what the system was built for, and finally what the image was that the creating agency wished to reflect. On the contrary, an analysis of the procedures which begins from their final products allows a verification of the discrepancies between rules and actuality and of the continuous mediation taking place between legal-administrative apparatus and society, and makes the reality attainable.  This has always been the primary purpose of diplomatic analysis, and its value has not decreased."

Bush and filed as a Federal Records Act (and Freedom of Information Act) challenge. The PROFS tapes contained, among other things, electronic mail messages of Oliver North concerning the Iran-Contra affair, transmitted over the NSC's internal e-mail system. [Citing Armstrong v. Bush, 721 F. Supp. 343, 345 n.1 (D.D.C. 1989).] . . . On January 6, 1993, as amended on January 11, Judge Charles R. Richey issued an injunction against the EOP (including the NSC), holding that based on the characteristics of the proprietary e-mail systems in place within the EOP and NSC at the time, the defendants' written records policies directing that hard copies of e-mail messages be printed out as the sole means of preserving e-mail records was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to the U.S. federal records laws. [Note: Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 810 F. Supp. 335 (D.D.C. 1993).] This holding was affirmed on later appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. [Note: See Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993). On January 15, 1993, the government's emergency motion for a partial stay of the district court's Order was granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals, allowing EOP components to delete e-mail messages from their live operating systems, so long as all record information was preserved in identical form on backup tapes.

Some cases take the view that material gathered by way of preliminary investigation does not become a public record before some official action of approval or disapproval.  On the other hand, the drawing of a distinction between writings representing tentative action and those memorializing ultimate action has been regarded as objectionable, not only because it is inconsistent with the principle which underlies the statutes making public writings freely available for inspection, but also because it provides a device by which a public official can hinder a citizen's legitimate attempt to obtain writings which are clearly within the strictest definition of a public record."

The use of the general term 'record' when referring to a particular type of record inevitably leads to confusion because attributes of the particular type are not conveyed by the general term. In particular, the legal definition of record may change, depending on relevant laws, rules, and regulations.  The general legal definition of public records is established in the Federal Records Act (44 USC 3301, cited below), but 'record' is defined for different purposes in the Privacy Act (5 USC \u00a7 552(a), cited below).   See also business record, which is defined in the Rules of Federal Evidence. ", 
        "Records are not synonymous with archives. While an archives collects records, not all records merit ongoing preservation.", 
        "'Record' connotes documents, rather than artifacts or published materials, although collections of records may contain artifacts and books.  To the extent that records are defined in terms of their function rather than their characteristics, the definition is stretched to include many materials not normally understood to be a record; an artifact may function as a record, even though it falls outside the vernacular understanding of the definition.",

A record's ability to fix information so that it can be repeated, recited, or recalled at a later date functions as an extension of memory and is at the heart of the concept of record.  A record may be created specifically to preserve information over time or to prevent future misinterpretation of that information, although a record cannot be presumed to be reliable without authentication.  However, any item - no matter how ephemeral it was intended to be - may serve as a record if it is later used as evidence of the thing to which it refers.", 
        "Fixity is the quality of content being stable and resisting change.  To preserve memory effectively, record content must be consistent over time.  Records made on mutable media, such as electronic records, must be managed so that it is possible to demonstrate that the content has not degraded or been altered.  A record may be fixed without being static.  A computer program may allow a user to analyze and view data many different ways.  A database itself may be considered a record if the underlying data is fixed and the same analysis and resulting view remain the same over time.", 
        "Structure refers to a record's physical characteristics and internal organization of the contents.  Record structure is the form that makes the content tangible and intelligible.  Physical characteristics include components and methods of assembly, such as paper, ink, seals, and font families, or character sets, encoding, and file formats.  Structure also includes the intellectual organization of a document.  A record's structure may be very simple, such as plain text on a page; it may be organized into an outline or sections with headings; or it may be highly complex, including a preamble, the body, and the signatures of witnesses.", 
        "A document's structure is contained within boundaries, which define the record as a unit and give it identity by distinguishing it from other information.  A record may consist of many physically or logically discrete parts that function together as unit, such as several pages or data values from many tables.  However, those parts must be bound together in some fashion.",

        "A record is often unique, whereas a publication is always created in multiple copies.  However, a record may be a single copy of many that has been selected for preservation or special treatment (a record copy).  For example, a publisher may keep one copy of each publication as a record. ", 
        "Record2, 3 is sometimes used to mean the record copy or official record, the complete, final, and authoritative version that is preserved.  This sense of record is distinguished from nonrecord or document3, which includes copies of the official record or materials that are not scheduled and can be disposed of without authorization.",

For example, an artifact may serve as a record if it is preserved to bolster human memory or to demonstrate accountability.",

The British practice, we believed, if applied in the National Archives, could lead sometimes to groupings too large for administrative convenience. We thought it better to divide the records of such large 'agencies' as departments into a number of separate record groups, usually reflecting the bureaus within departments and of 'convenient size' for administration.\n\n\u00b6  On the Continent the French term 'fonds d'archives' \u2013 meaning the body or stock of records of a record-creating unit \u2013 was widely known in archival literature and accepted as the basis of arrangement work. . . .  As applied in practice, the records of any subordinate office that kept records, no matter how small the office, were considered a 'fonds.'  This was going to the other extreme of 'convenient size,' and the 'record group' principle as defined in the National Archives united the records of subordinate offices under their superior offices, usually up to the bureau level.  Also the records of small though essentially independent satellite agencies were often included with the records of major agencies to which they were related."

The record continuum, on the other hand, has provided Australian records managers and archivists with a way of thinking about the integration of record-keeping and archiving processes.\n\n\u00b6  The life cycle model sees records passing through stages until they eventually 'die', except for the 'chosen ones' that are reincarnated as archives. A continuum-based approach suggests integrated time-space dimensions. Records are 'fixed' in time and space from the moment of their creation, but record-keeping regimes carry them forward and enable their use for multiple purposes by delivering them to people living in different times and spaces.

It is particularly intended for representing metadata about Web resources, such as the title, author, and modification date of a Web page, copyright and licensing information about a Web document, or the availability schedule for some shared resource. However, by generalizing the concept of a 'Web resource', RDF can also be used to represent information about things that can be identified on the Web, even when they cannot be directly retrieved on the Web. Examples include information about items available from on-line shopping facilities (e.g., information about specifications, prices, and availability), or the description of a Web user's preferences for information delivery.\n\n\u00b6  RDF is intended for situations in which this information needs to be processed by applications, rather than being only displayed to people.

While it is the task of paleography to determine what type of script is proper to an era and an environment, it is the task of diplomatics to examine other characteristics of the script, such as the layout of the writing with respect to the physical form of the document, the presence of different hands or types of writing in the same document, the correspondence between paragraphs and conceptual sections of the text, type of punctuation, abbreviations, initialisms, ink, erasures, corrections, etc. With the invention of the printing press, and later, of the typewriter, some of these characteristics became irrelevant to the purpose of diplomatic criticism.  The need for careful examination of these characteristics is arising again, however, thanks to the advent of new technology.  Computer software, for example, may be considered as part of the extrinsic 'script,' because it determines the layout and articulation of the discourse, and can provide information about provenance, procedures, processes, uses, modes of transmission and, last but not least, authenticity."

In some contexts, a signature records the signer's approval or authorization of the signed record and the signer's intention to give it legal effect.  A signature also has some ceremonial significance, and can impart a sense of clarity and finality to a record or transaction.

However, the processes that interested parties follow to establish standards can differ dramatically. Standards can either be de facto (occurring as a result of natural market movement and adoption) or prescribed (established by formal agreement). De facto standards often result when one vendor dominates a market, while prescribed standards develop in competitive environments where market participants realize that agreement upon a standard will benefit all of the participants. De facto standards incite little argument, because the market as a whole decides them. However, prescribed standards cause much consternation, because of the often contentious processes that lead to their establishment."

Blankbooks, including court record books, which are generally required for permanent records, are bound in a different style from letterpress work because not only must the binding withstand heavy use, it must also open very flat for writing purposes."

The confusion owes to the incompatibility between two different views of URI partitioning, which we call the 'classical' and 'contemporary' views.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6  1.1 Classical View\n\u00b6  During the early years of discussion of web identifiers (early to mid 90s), people assumed that an identifier type would be cast into one of two (or possibly more) classes. An identifier might specify the location of a resource (a URL) or its name (a URN) independent of location. Thus a URI was either a URL or a URN. There was discussion about generalizing this by addition of a discrete number of additional classes; for example, a URI might point to metadata rather than the resource itself, in which case the URI would be a URC (citation). URI space was thus viewed as partitioned into subspaces: URL and URN, and additional subspaces, to be defined. The only such additional space ever proposed was URC and there never was any buy-in; so without loss of generality it's reasonable to say that URI space was thought to be partitioned into two classes: URL and URN. Thus for example, 'http:' was a URL scheme, and 'isbn:' would (someday) be a URN scheme. Any new scheme would be cast into one or the other of these two classes.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6  1.2 Contemporary View\n\u00b6  Over time, the importance of this additional level of hierarchy seemed to lessen; the view became that an individual scheme does not need to be cast into one of a discrete set of URI types such as 'URL', 'URN', 'URC', etc. Web-identifier schemes are in general URI schemes; a given URI scheme may define subspaces. Thus 'http:' is a URI scheme. 'urn:' is also a URI scheme; it defines subspaces, called 'namespaces'. For example, the set of URNs of the form 'urn:isbn:n-nn-nnnnnn-n' is a URN namespace. ('isbn' is an URN namespace identifier. It is not a 'URN scheme' nor a 'URI scheme').\n\n\u00b6  Further according to the contemporary view, the term 'URL' does not refer to a formal partition of URI space; rather, URL is a useful but informal concept: a URL is a type of URI that identifies a resource via a representation of its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network 'location'), rather than by some other attributes it may have. Thus as we noted, 'http:' is a URI scheme. An http URI is a URL. The phrase 'URL scheme' is now used infrequently, usually to refer to some subclass of URI schemes which exclude URNs."

Of course, if no archival theory or practice could be allowed unless it was 'perfect,' we would have not theory or practice.  Ultimately, the question becomes whether appraisal based on [use analysis], granted its many imperfections, is better or worse than the proposed practical alternatives. The second is that its practicality and broad applicability depends upon a growing number of use studies. Because every repository serves a somewhat different clientele, has a different mandate from its resource allocators, and must deploy different resources, in an ideal world, every repository would do it own detailed use studies for every segment of its collections.  These could be as simple as the MHS call-slip analysis, as complex as a process of user interviews, or as intensive as a citation analysis.  The world not being ideal, most repositories will have to extrapolate from studies done by similar institutions regarding similar records.  The third is that this is not a Magic Bullet.  Utilitarian appraisal does not equal 'easy' appraisal.  Unless we abandon appraisal as an archival responsibility, we will never make appraisal easy because we can never make it scientific or mechanistic.  If it were otherwise, I am convinced, there would be absolutely no reason for archivists to exist.  But a utilitarian method will provide a better rigor and rationale for appraisal decisions."

Primary values are those reflecting the basic business purpose(s) served by the records, the reason they were created. Secondary values reflect other uses to which the information may be put during the course of their life cycle, uses that may justify continuing retention after the expiration of primary values. Administrative or operational values are usually identified as primary values. Research or historical values are generally designated as secondary values. Legal value can be either a primary or a secondary value, depending on the purpose and function of a record. A records series can (and usually does) possess several of these values simultaneously, and they may change during a record's life cycle."

The Johns Hopkins Variorum Edition of Edmund Spenser, for instance, includes notes not only by that edition's editors, but by dozens of earlier critics, going back to the eighteenth century: for any passage in Spenser, the reader can see what earlier commentators have had to say about it.\n\n\u00b6  Other variorum editions reproduce not critical commentary but textual variants and conjectural emendations proposed by many other editors. The Arden Shakespeare, for example, gives the readings in all the important early witnesses (the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century quartos and folios), and, when they're relevant, the readings proposed by editors from the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries."

What is more, writing was in itself coming to be recognized as an effective way for gathering and sharing information: some people would now learn things only from books, Bede realized."

The Web trivialized this original Xanadu model, vastly but incorrectly simplifying these problems to a world of fragile ever-breaking one-way links, with no recognition of change or copyright, and no support for multiple versions or principled re-use.  Fonts and glitz, rather than content connective structure, prevail. \n\n\u00b6 Serious electronic literature (for scholarship, detailed controversy and detailed collaboration) must support bidirectional and profuse links, which cannot be embedded; and must offer facilities for easily tracking re-use on a principled basis among versions and quotations. \n\n\u00b6 Xanalogical literary structure is a unique symmetrical connective system for text (and other separable media elements), with two complementary forms of connection that achieve these functions \u2013 survivable deep linkage (content links) and recognizable, visible re-use (transclusion).  Both of these are easily implemented by a document model using content lists which reference stabilized media."
